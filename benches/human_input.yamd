I was born in the Soviet Union and missed the whole “Pale blue dot” thing. But there are so many references to it in
pop culture that I stopped ignoring it and bought the book at some point. The book is outdated a bit, which is expected
for a science book that is 44 years old. Now we know what killed dinosaurs. Voyager 1 is outside the solar system. The
existence of gravitational waves was experimentally proven. Etc. What is more impressive is that most of the stuff in
the book is still valid.

The book has a big chapter about Newton. I had this silly thought/idea/feeling that our ancestors had an easy time
science-wise. There were many low-hanging fruits to discover, and I thought that the greatness of scientists was
exaggerated a bit. And you know what, I was wrong. Newton was as great as one can be. The stuff he accomplished four
hundred years ago is mind-blowing as a new science.

I already knew that all elements in the universe, except hydrogen and maybe helium, were produced in stars. What I
didn’t know is that we calculated, with pretty high precision, how much gold, or any other element, is in the universe.
Given that we still don’t know how big our universe is, being able to calculate that number blows my mind.

And do you know why the Milky Way is milky? That’s because Greeks believed that the thing in the night sky was Hera’s
breast milk. Yep. Do whatever you want with that knowledge.

The most mind-blowing thing in the book is about whales. I know that whales are singing songs. I even listened to
recordings of those songs years ago. What I did not know is that whales could communicate with each other thousands
of kilometers apart. Until we polluted 20Hz frequency with engine noises. Now, it is only around 300 km. I can’t
imagine how that would feel. They also “write” those songs collaboratively and can repeat them years later. They can
even stop in the middle and then resume from the point they stopped a year later.

Throughout the book, Carl points out that even if there is another intelligent life out here, it would be rare and
different. There are no other humans in the vast universe and the fact that we are killing each other for stupid
reasons is unacceptable. And I agree.

That was a good read.

I don’t know what more to say. If you liked any work by Douglas Adams (who doesn’t?), you will like this adaptation.
Ah, it is short and can be read in less than a day. No excuses. Go and read it ☺️

To my surprise, I haven't heard about Ranulph Fiennes before this book. I mean, I am sure that I heard something about 
the greatest living explorer (according to the Guinness Book of Records and me) but never paid enough attention. His 
whole life is a monument of unbelievable willpower. He planned and executed adventures that I do not even dream of. 
Like crossing both poles, climbing the North Face and Everest, discovering a lost city in Oman, running seven marathons 
on seven continents in seven days, and that's not even a full list. 

While reading the book, I asked myself multiple times if that was what I wanted to do. And while I would like to see 
Everest up close, I never wanted to climb it. Or I can imagine how good one can feel when he crosses one of the ice 
caps, but I know for sure that I am not ready to cut off some of my fingertips because of frostbite. In general, I do 
not have a strong desire to be the first, fastest, or whatever. I want to be a tourist with as much adventure as I can 
take, which is not much adventure if you compare it with Ranulph's adventures or too much for some other people.  

At the end of the book, he advises the polar traveler wannabe. Which I greatly appreciate, even though I do not plan 
to go on polar expeditions. Most of that advice can be applied to any adventure, so if you plan one, read the book. 

Florian recommended that book to me. Be like Florian and recommend some good books. 

One more thing. I do not call my adventures “expeditions” yet, but if, for some unknown reason, you want 
to sponsor one of them, I am soooo ready.

This book was hard to read. I think the translation was done poorly. Initially, it was written in German by a
non-native speaker, and then someone translated it into English. Sometimes, sentences do not make sense at all.

But there are some good ideas that I haven’t heard before. One is that images are about space, and music is about
time. I tried hard to remember a piece of music or a picture that would break out of those constraints and failed.
Second is the idea that the canvas has built-in tension depending on its form. I can say that those two times I was
looking at an empty canvas, it felt different if they were in landscape or a portrait position. Also, the square
canvas is dead because there is no tension, which makes sense and should be used to amplify the artist’s idea.

He talks a lot about the temperature or sound of a line/dot/plane, which I was not able to follow. It felt like he was
trying to find the proper names/words for stuff he explained, but he ultimately lost me. Again, that may be a result
of a poor translation.

I remember that I wanted to read more fiction, but hear me out.

At some point, borrow checker will force you to slap that Arc and Mutex on some of your HashMaps, Vec’s, and what have 
you. If you want to know answers to what, why, and all other important questions, as I did, I highly recommend Mara’s 
answer. 

A big chunk of the book is atomics and memory ordering. And, I think, for the first time, the ordering concept kind of 
clicked for me. One particular thing is that despite wanting the strongest guarantee possible, most of the time, you 
need a relaxed one. But it is so subtle that right now, if I need to specify memory ordering, I'll go and reread that 
chapter.

One more thing. Rust itself is good at expressing safety mechanisms like locks. This should not be news, right? But 
how often have you thought about the implementation of a Mutex? For me answer is maybe once before this book. And the 
fact that Rust allows you to express API of it in a compile-time checkable way, makes me appreciate the language even 
more.

A Philosophy of Software Design - the must-read for software engineers.

I would say that this is the best book I have read so far on the «building good software» topic.

Pretty often, authors forget that every technic, pattern, or trick they describe as good can be taken too far. But John Ousterhout does not fall into this trap and writes “taking it too far” chapters. Literally.

In general, every piece of advice he gives resonates with my experience. I am not sure if I would fully appreciate these advices early in my career. But still will recommend this book for everyone who wants to write good software.

And, it is short. You will not loose much time reading it. So if you into building software read it :)

I wish all technical books were this good. It not only walks you through the necessary steps to create your programming
language but also includes a lot of context, memes, and references.

It is also a huge and intimidating book. I do not think I would start reading it if I would not writing
[YAMD](https://github.com/Lurk/yamd). Even though YAMD is not a programming language, one can name a resulting code -
interpreter. And I can say that most of the [recent changes](/post/yamd-0.14.0-release.html) in the codebase of YAMD
were inspired by this book.

It also enriched my vocabulary and allowed me to search for the correct stuff. The frequency of “Oh, that's what it is”
moments was unbelievably high. That is a good thing but also very distracting. My mind was constantly carried away by
new ideas requiring further reading or experiments. That significantly contributed to the amount of time I spent
reading it.

I want to highlight two documents Robert goes through in the book. They greatly impacted the software engineering in
general and are a good read on themselves.

[Top-down operator presence by Vaughan R. Pratt](https://tdop.github.io/)

[Goto statement considered harmful by Edgar Dijkstra](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~storm/teaching/reader/Dijkstra68.pdf)

Go and read them even if you don't plan to read the book.

It will be a good read for you to geekout. It will be a great read if you want to learn what lexer, parser,
context-free grammar, AST, bytecode, etc. are.

If you ask me today what one book of all books I must read to understand software development, this is it. It
goes into every little detail about how the software will break and gives you tools to avoid that.

The name is a bit misleading. For some reason, I was expecting terabyte-crunching algorithms from the beginning.
But no, the book covers cases from your load that can fit into the memory of one machine, and one core is enough - to
multi-datacenter transactions and batch processing.

My only complaint - it is huge. Which is understandable, given the number of topics covered.

All my nerdy senses were pleased by this book. I highly recommend it.

Linus was (and still is) my Hero with capital H for a long time. But just recently, I found out that there is a book from/about him. So I bought it, and boy, it is good. All my nerdy memories (someday I will write stuff about school days, how we with my friends tried to create our operating system because windows suck) were alive again while I read it.

If you somehow missed it, as I did, and you are a nerd yourself or want to understand nerds - I highly recommend it.

And couple more words about role models. I get why guys like Steve Jobs, Mark Zuckerberg, or Elon Musk are considered role models for many people. But I don't think that we as humanity need more Steves or Marks, or even more Elon's. But I am 100% sure that we need a lot more people like Linus.

The First British Woman to Motorcycle Around the World

Everyone who knows me knows that I am quite an adventurous person. And one of my big dreams is to make motorcycle trip around the world. That is the reason why I started this book. Elseph made my dream trip almost 40 years ago. And that was Adventure with capital A. The story is also very personal. Reading it felt like your friend telling you the stories from her life.

And it confirms all my biases about the countries she passed through. All except Australia. I was waiting for stories about venomous spiders riding giant snakes but got Goldwing riding scum instead. And Nepal, now I want to visit this gorgeous country even more. 

Must read if you are an adventurous person, even more, if you are motorcycle adventurous :)

The best competency porn out there. 

What I like about Andy Weir’s works is that his main characters are ordinary people who are just good at their jobs. 
You can argue that astronauts are not ordinary people. And you are right. I guess. But what I meant is that they don't 
have any superpowers. Like you know, there is a problem, and they suck at solving it at the beginning. Then, they 
figure it out using their skills and a bit of luck. And when they see that problem again - they do not suck anymore. 

I want more of that everywhere. 

Being good at your job is sexy.

Idiomatic programming for experienced developers.

The book goes deep into interface design, memory layout, concurrency, testing, no std, and so on. Multiple times, while reading it, I had “oh, that's how it should be done” moments. So I would say If you are writing software using Rust, this book is must read. It does not repeat the Rust book, and assumes that you already familiar with the language. In general, I like how the author explains things, and if you are not subscribed to his [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonGjengset), I would suggest doing that.

The high-level design of different systems, from URL shorteners to YouTube. And It reads surprisingly fast. Sadly, I
didn't read that book earlier. That would help to avoid some mistakes I made in the past.

I understand that this was not the author's aim, and it is probably impossible to contain all details in one book, but
for me, it was not deep enough. Designing storage, CDN, video transcoder, or conflict resolution systems is hard, but
that makes it exciting, right?

Anyway, I had a nice feeling while reading it. You know, when you read something and nod to it. I think the only
surprise for me was the lack of Verimatrix in the list of DRM. But, to be honest, I do not know if they ever had a
client of a YouTube size.

Overall I am glad that I read that book.

A 500ish page instruction on how to dream big.

This book is about how we got here. How all that connectivity and supercomputers in our pockets were envisioned and born.

We are living in a world that was the dream of a really small group of people. I am not sure if it is a manifestation of genius, or right time in the right place thing, or both. But I am glad that those particular, no doubt brilliant, people were in that place at that time. And that is one more reinforcement of the idea that people do matter.

And also how open standards eventually win. Two opposite examples are networking and printing. Networking is built mainly on open standards. Printing is primarily the opposite. The network is flourishing, and printing as an activity is universally hated. This is ironic if you consider that both ideas were under active development in PARC.

At the end of the book, you can find “Man-Computer Symbiosis” by J.C.R. Licklider. It is a must-read, even if you want to skip the book. It is pretty short and densely packed with ideas. There is no excuse not to read it, so here is the link: [Man-Computer Symbiosis](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/medg/people/psz/Licklider.html). In the book, there are two more texts, “[Intergalactic Network](https://www.kurzweilai.net/memorandum-for-members-and-affiliates-of-the-intergalactic-computer-network)” by J.C.R. Licklider and “[The computer as a communication device](https://internetat50.com/references/Licklider_Taylor_The-Computer-As-A-Communications-Device.pdf)" by J.C.R. Licklider, co-authored with Robert Taylor. They are also worth reading.

I found so many thoughts and ideas in this book that still holds that I will need to copy-paste half of it to discuss. Instead, I finish with one quote from the book, which is a quote from “Man-Computer Symbiosis” I mentioned earlier. It is about man part of Man-Computer Symbiosis.

!!
! quote left
About 85 percent of my "thinking" time was spent getting into a position to think to make a decision, to learn something I needed to know. Much more time went into finding or obtaining information than into digesting it.
!!

I can say that, 60 years later, it is true. At least for me. While information access has become infinitely faster, I still spend more than half of my “thinking“ time searching and digesting the information I need to solve current tasks, which is terrible in terms of my efficiency. But also good because I consider it as an indication that I am not solving the same problem over and over, which would be boring.

And that is what I am really curious about. How much time do people spend searching and digesting information nowadays? If you have seen some studies about that, please send me a link. Or/And write me about your personal experience.

Nerdy jokes and ultimate death.

I do not know if it is only me or if it is like that for everybody, but I do not have any mental model for thinking
about the early times of the universe. And I celebrate moments when I found a good one. 

As I get it -  in The big bang time, universe was so full of energy that all forces we know behaved differently. By
differently, I mean there was no gravity or electromagnetic, or any other known to us, force. So yeah, no need to go to
the gym because there is no mass. Then, due to a rapid space expansion (please don't ask me why it expands), the energy
level in every part of the universe dropped enough to change the State. Katie Mack, suggests water as an analogy. The
water state is different depending on how much energy (heat) you put in. And this analogy had more value for me than 
the entire A brief history of time.

And even if the water thingy is no good for you, the book is fun to read if you like nerdy jokes.

Book about how to manage people, and be managed by other people

This is the book you should read as early as possible in your tech career, despite the name. After reading it, you will understand what and why people around you want from you, which will help your daily activities.

My takeaways are:

- Now, the work I did in the past has a proper name. For example, once I managed three teams, but since our carrier ladder was awful, my position was - Systems architect. I was responsible for architecture because we had no tech lead, but what everybody wanted from me was those team productivity. Now I know that I was engineering manager, and Instead of making architectural decisions, I should have hired tech leads.
- Mentors are important. Both having and being one.
- 1-1s are super important for everybody.

The most useful book you can read.

Have you been in a situation where you are reading a book and your thoughts run away so far that you need to reread a
couple of pages when they come back? That was constantly happening with me when I was reading this book. Not because
it is not interesting, but because almost on every page, or at least on every chapter, I was like - oh, that's why I do
this. Or - oh, that's why advertisement, news, politics, science, etc., works like that.

Not every idea was new for me, but the book goes into a detailed explanation of every experiment that was done to prove
or disprove the point. And it is fascinating.

I got this book in Russian translation, and I feel that some bits are missing during translation. The title translated
like 'Think slowly decide quickly', which is far from the original. So yeah, I definitely will reread this book in
English.

If you have been on the internet for a long enough time, you know the XKCD and Randall Munroe. Randall also wrote a
book. And a good one.

The book teaches you about physics, and chemistry, and biology, and history, and all other boring stuff in a fun and
entertaining way.

There is not much to say about it without spoilers, but the book does what the headline says - scientific answers to
stupid questions. You can go to the xkcd website and read some of them. One of my favorites is about baseball and the
speed of light.

I have been lucky to have my first computer at age six. It was Atari 65XE, with BASIC programming language built-in.
Since then, computers have been my passion, and I have never stopped programming.

I was launching some startups with various levels of success. The usual level of success was a failure. But that was
always fun and educational. 10/10. I will do it again.

In my free of screen time, I do [adventurous stuff](/tag/adventures.html) and sometimes play

“The Most Beautiful Sound Next to Silence” 

Last week, the [ECM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECM_Records) label published all the releases that previously were 
only on vinyl online. Steve Reich is unbelievably good.

I am still looking for the full release on YouTube. That is why there is a link only to the Music for 18 Musicians.

I heard somewhere the phrase:  `Talking about music is the same as dancing about architecture`. And that is exactly
how I feel.  I often don’t know what to say. I do not have enough vocabulary to express why some music hits in the
right place. The time is also not easy to find. Time to slow down enough to write something that makes sense is even
more rare.

If you are in a chilly mood and want something as beautiful as mountains, hit play.

These Norwegian guys made (and I really hope that someday they will get together and make a couple more albums) Music

I just recently discovered this band, and they are interesting not only because of the music they play, which is good, but also the lyrics. I am genuinely amazed that something like this exists around Harry Potter. If you read/watched Harry with pleasure, put your headphones on and hit the play button.

I have always liked music but never thought it would get me this far. Today, I released an album. It includes pieces
that I recorded over three years.

Honestly, that’s the coolest thing I have ever done.

I guess this all resulted from me finding an instrument that allows me to make sounds that I like in the most obvious,
for me, way. But I still don’t have a clue what I’m doing. I mean, I found a few tricks to get me to the place I like,
but in the grand scheme of things, music theory and all that, I know nothing.  On the other hand, I am not sure if I
want to invest time into learning all that instead of playing. At least for now, I do not feel the absence of hard
knowledge of music science as a showstopper.

I don't know what genre it is. Incidentally, that often happens with music I like. I guess weird electronic music
describes it in the best way. But since I need to tag it somehow before publishing, here we go: dungeonsynth,
industrial, ambient, drones.

I want to thank Marie and all my friends, whom I have been forcing to listen to all those weird noises and who have
always supported me <3

## One more thing ™

Apart from music itself, there is one more artifact. I got carried away while making the cover, and at some point, it
became interactive `¯\\_(ツ)_/¯`.

I was into this kind of music in 2001. And even though  I did not understand the lyrics, this album blew my mind when it came out. At some point, I moved on to other genres, and it disappeared from my playlist a long time ago. 

Today, I stumbled upon it, and it blew my mind again.

That was a tough year, no doubt. In January, I was happy and planned our summer adventure. We wanted to hike the 
Everest base camp trail.  And in February, I cried between phone calls, helping refugees cross the border and find 
transport or accommodation. 

It's unbelievably dumb. Every time I think about it, it does not make any sense. No gain can justify so much death, 
destruction, and suffering. And the worst thing is that there is no end to this madness.

At some point, my wife and I agreed that we needed to disconnect because it was overwhelming. We went on a two-week 
hike, which turned out to be the best vacation we ever had. You can read about it here: 
[We crossed the Alps](/post/crossers_of_the_alps).

Job-wise, there are no significant changes. I've done a ton of technical interviews. And I got much better at helping 
candidates navigate through the task. Oh, I got an email saying management put me on the top performer's list. It 
looks like I am doing a good job.

I was not as active as I wanted to be in the open-source side of building software thing. Those are the pull requests 
I closed:

- [Semantic-Org](https://github.com/Semantic-Org), / ,[Semantic-UI-React](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React), / ,[fix: make typings compatible with @types/react@18 #4356](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/Semantic-UI-React/pull/4356)

And those are the books I read this year:

- [The Manager's Path](/post/the_managers_path)
- [Linux Kernel Development](/post/linux_kernel_development)
- [The End of Everything](/post/the_end_of_everything)
- [Rust for Rustaceans](/post/rust_for_rustaceans)

I hope that next year will be more productive.

At some point, I wanted to draw a cat. And you know, cats are hard to draw. I also spent some time making noises, but 
not enough to publish it somewhere. Maybe next year.

![Fosdinovo castle neighborhood](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1672412787/2022/fosdinovo.jpg)

Yeah, life is so unpredictable. If in January, someone told me that instead of everything I wanted to happen, Russia 
would invade Ukraine, then we would cross the Alps and finish the year next to the castle of Fosdinovo, I would be 
surprised. And that looks like a lesson that there is no reason to plan something big. Which I refuse to learn.

See you next year.

Unfortunately, that’s a bad sign when you start a year review with the word unfortunately, but what can I do? 
Unfortunately, there is still no sign of the war ending. Most Ukrainians understand that If they give up, those who 
will survive occupation will go to die in a war with Georgia, Armenia, Moldova, Latvia, Kazakhstan, Finland, or you 
name it, under the Russian flag. And if someone hopes that by some miracle Russia will stop, well, it will not stop 
from the inside. Most Russians are okay with what is going on.

## What I did do this year? 

### Software: 

This year I had no contributions to other projects but merged a few in my own. It was surprising that someone used my 
stuff and even wanted to improve it. 

The list of software that I maintain is growing. 

- [BAR](https://github.com/Lurk/bar) static site generator. Is in a super early stage, but this blog is a working demo. 
- [YAMD](https://github.com/Lurk/yamd) yet another markdown (flavor)
- [Clink](https://github.com/Lurk/clink) cross-platform URL cleaner. 
- [Cloudinary Rust API](https://github.com/Lurk/cloudinary_rs)
- [Serve](https://github.com/Lurk/serve) a simple tool to serve static files over the network. This blog is a working demo. 

All my side projects are now in Rust. Still getting in fights with the borrow checker now and then, but most of the 
time it is a butter-smooth experience.

The whole year I was using Neovim as my main IDE. I tried some of the prebuilt config distributions and settled on the 
[AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com) with some [tweaks of mine](https://github.com/Lurk/astronvim_user). The reason I 
got into it was rust-analyzer. I have not found a way to make it work with JetBrains stuff, and for some reason, I do 
not like vsCode. So far there are two things I still have not figured out: 

+ debugging. I know about dap and dap-ui. Just didn’t find time to figure out how to configure it. 
+ Autosave + autoformat brakes undo/redo and makes me crazy. 

Oh yeah, and last month of a year I was busy with Advent of Code. I am still on day 17, but I am not planning to give 
up.

![nvim](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1703948622/2023/nvim.png)

### Adventures:

This year I managed to have two big adventures:

- [TET Turkey](https://barhamon.com/post/tet_turkey_ride.html). 
- [Tour du Mont Blanc hike](https://barhamon.com/post/tmb-2023.html). 

And a few small ones. Which is more than usual, but I like it and do not plan to stop. This year I tried multiday 
bikepacking. And looks like I am going to do more of it next year. 

![adventures](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/tet-turkey/ride/bikes/1_-_9_afzitc.jpg)

### Music:

This was the most productive year for me as a musician. I recorded five tracks. At some point, I even started to think 
about releasing an album on vinyl, but haven’t found the inspiration/time to make enough tracks.

{{soundcloud|https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/1579457740&color=%232b2a2a&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true}}

### Paintings:

I really like how oil behaves on canvas, and would like to spend more time exploring it. But there are so many things 
to do and so little time, looks like one painting in a year is my pace.

![everything will be all right](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1703951412/2023/everything-will-be-all-right.png)

### Books:

I was so busy with everything else that there are only four books that I managed to finish this year: 

- [The Dream Machine by M. Mitchell Waldrop](https://barhamon.com/books/the_dream_machine.html)
- [Systems design interview by Alex Xu](https://barhamon.com/books/systems_design_interview.html)
- [Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppmann](https://barhamon.com/books/designing_data_intensive_applications.html)
- [Point and Line to Plane by Wassily Kandinsky](https://barhamon.com/books/Point-and-Line-to-Plane-by-Wassily-Kandinsky.html)

I want to read more fiction next year. 

### Work-related stuff: 

This year I got promoted to a lead developer at Check24. And I thought that there would be no changes in my position 
for the next years. But a few months back my manager asked if I wanted to try myself in a team lead role and I said 
yes. Now I manage a team of three engineers and figuring out how to measure my productivity in a new role.

See you next year and happy holidays.

I was infinitely more active on social media compared to me now. There were days when I would post multiple posts on
Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. I can't do it anymore. I don't know why.

I am trying to be active on Mastodon. I like the idea of a decentralized, algorithm-free social network based on open
standards, but it feels silly most of the time. On the other hand, I really like the “This Day 20 years ago you were
doing this” feature of social networks. And it keeps me going.

I want to try a new format. Once in a while, I would gather my favorite pictures and write something about them. Now,
when the gallery is done, it finally makes sense.

Okay.

My toe finally healed enough to start cycling to work again. I forgot how fast I am on a bicycle and how much I enjoy
it. It was also foggy, mad maxy, with rare sunny days.

Then, I went to Florence for the RustLab conference. I geeked out as hard as I could and met many nice people. I want
to do it next year, but definitely with a couple of extra days because my schedule was tough.

Regular days.

It is time to be honest, and say "I will not finish it". Come on, it is the middle of February. But it was a good run 
anyway.

If you like: WTF is [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023/about) <-- click that link.

For the first time, in many years since I first heard about it, I found time to participate. I solved twenty and a half 
out of twenty-five puzzles. Up until tenth day, I was able to keep up with a few hours after work schedule. After that, 
puzzles became more complex, and I started to lag behind. And day twelve was the day when I could not solve second part 
of a puzzle at all.

I used Rust, and it was a good choice. I do not think I would be more productive with any other language. At the same 
time, I feel like now I have fewer skill issues than before. This is the exact result I hoped for. So, no regrets.

One of unexpected side effects was that I started to feel numbers. I know that it sounds weird, but I can not find a 
better way to describe it. You know when you look at the number and feel the urge to deduct one and divide it half. 
Which turns out to be the answer you are looking for. That kind of feeling.

Will I participate in this year’s Advent? I hope so. I enjoyed the puzzles and the feeling when you finally figured 
out how to solve them. So yeah, if nothing out of the ordinary (the bar for the ordinary is already really high) 
happens, I will participate in the next Advent of Code. 

Below are my notes. If you still want to solve this year’s puzzles, SPOILER ALERT.

## [Day 1](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1)

Off by one errors everywhere. 

## [Day 2](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/2)

Today's calculation will have two parts: `one` and `two`. 

The initial idea of using `PartialOrd` to compare Round's was bad. 

## [Day 3](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/3)

IDK if I should support all previous days. It seems like little work.

Today's task is much more complex than previous ones. Tests are required. 

There is a huge potential to optimize, but it is Sunday, and I still need to finish the first Fallout.

## [Day 4](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/4)

Part one was surprisingly easy. 

Part two was hard to understand, probably because of the fever.

## [Day 5](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/5)

The brute force approach takes too much time.

`rayon` goes brrrr

The test case for part two passes, but the answer is incorrect. I am a sad panda. 

Oooooh. The range in maps is not inclusive. So, I passed the first stage and test assignment by luck :)

## [Day 6](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/6)

That was easier than day 1.

## [Day 7](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/7)

The day when my neat little abstraction broke on part two, and now it is not as beautiful as it can be.

## [Day 8](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/8)

Today is the day when brute force is no go. 

After a couple of hours of looking at the debug output - we are looping with the same intervals. Which means what we 
need to do is find all loop lengths and the LCM of those. 

My math is rusty. Let’s do naive LCM.

The result in 3m is ok. I guess.

I could not relax, so I googled how people calculate LCM. It turned out that more than 2000 years ago, our boy Euclid 
had already [figured it all out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor#Euclidean_algorithm).

Now it is `blazingly (TM)` fast. 

## [Day 9](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/9)

To solve today's riddle, I wrote the least amount of code.

## [Day 10](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/10)

I was trying to clear the map from unconnected pipes instead of following the trail. I spent a few hours before 
realizing there was an easier way to solve part one. 

Part two. 

Ok, first idea, since we have our loop of pipes from part one. Let’s replace all tiles that are not connected to the 
main loop with zeroes. 

I think I can simplify the loop itself by shortening 180 turns. For example, this transformation: 

```Plain Text
0000
0F70
0||0
```

Can be:

```Plain Text
0000
0..0
0F70
```

Without losing information.

That was a bad idea. I spent too much time implementing it before realizing it did not lead me anywhere. The better 
one is to follow the loop and mark left/right. One of the sides will be inside and the other outside. Fill the void 
and count. 

The code is ugly as hell, but it gives the correct result. 

I added some love to it before starting the next day. Also, the way I did pipes sucks. 

```rust
Tile::Pipe(Direction::North, Direction::East)
```

That's an `L` pipe. Yeah, I know. It’s not obvious at all. 

## [Day 11](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/11)

Somehow, columns are hard. I have spent too much time implementing universe expansion. Everything else was easy.

Part two does not fit into memory. Even if I make it fit into the memory with 
[bitvec](https://docs.rs/bitvec/latest/bitvec/) or a similar bit-manipulating library, the amount of data to process 
will be too big to process in a sane amount of time. 

The current idea is to expand the universe a few times. Find the speed at which galaxies are moving away from each 
other. Knowing the speed end distance should be easy to find.

I am already lagging one day behind, so the best move is to go to sleep.

That Idea about speed was terrible. I spent too much time figuring out how to measure the expansion rate, and none of 
my measurements made sense. Anyway, the working idea is that instead of expanding the universe, you can gather the 
position of galaxies and manipulate those positions. 

I will not rewrite the first part. 

## [Day 12](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/12)

TBH, I do not know where to start. I will start with a nap.

Part one was hard. I had no clue where to start until I saw this post: 
[Solving Nonograms with 120 Lines of Code](https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-nonograms-with-120-lines-of-code-a7c6e0f627e4).

Again. Tests are green, but the result is wrong :(

I gave up and looked at Reddit. This was the test case that I was missing `??#???##?? 1,3`

I did not solve part two with brute force. Despite spending 46 nanoseconds on checking each combination, some rows had 
so many of them that solving them requires a few hours. 

With a Christmas party and hangover after it, I am lagging five days behind :(

Ok. Instead of generating all possible combinations, I can use a tree. `??#???##?? 1,3` can be 

```Plain Text
                            _/\_

     ^        ^                                         - 1,3 are possible
```

Where (spring index) | (group index)

Now, while I can eyeball what is possible and what is not, somehow, I can not think of a way to solve it elegantly :(

Yeah, so a few hours and a bunch of ifs later, tests are passing. The first part produces the same result as before. 
Everything is super fast. But, the result is `too low`. 

I added more tests. They are also green. The result is still wrong. It may be time to give up and go to Reddit. 

All test cases that I found on Reddit are also green. 

I am giving up. I can't come up with a test case that would fail. I will go and do other puzzles.

## [Day 13](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/13)

Part one was easy, which had a healing effect on my ego after the previous day's failure. 

The main struggle in the second part was getting what I needed to do. But I managed.

## [Day 14](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/14)

Part one is solved by splitting and sorting.

I knew that brute force would not work. I tried anyway, and even a small test case was not finished in a reasonable 
time. Debug output shows that the results are cycling after some number of iterations. The current plan is:

- cycle detection
- cycle length/start extraction 

Easy.

TBH, I did not expect it to be easy. But it was.

## [Day 15](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/15)

Part one is surprisingly easy.

Every day, I fear that it will be day 12 all over again. But not this day.

## [Day 16](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/16)

Moving the light beam was easy since I already had stuff like `Map` and `Direction` from previous days. Only 
complication was the fact that there is a lot of movement, and you need to remember from which tile to which direction 
you have already moved.  

Also, today, I managed to do three parts before going to sleep. Kind of proud of myself :)

Part two was even easier. I thought that I would need to use some black magic to speed things up, but everything was 
fast enough already.

## [Day 17](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/17)

Of course, I can google `Dijkstra's algorithm`, but it would be too easy. 

I am so proud of myself. My homegrown algorithm does find the shortest path on test data in only 10 minutes :) It dies
with stack overflow on the actual data. It may be time to call Dijkstra for help.

I spent some time reading [Dijkstra's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra's_algorithm) and can't figure 
out how to apply the no more than three steps in one direction rule to it. But reading it gave me an idea that I want 
to try. 

For every point on the map, we have a few directions we can go. The amount of those directions depends on the three 
previous ones. This means that for every pair of `([Option<Direction>;3], index)`, we can remember the minimum 
distance. 

That works very well. The test run finishes in 0.04 seconds, much better than 10 minutes. Run on actual data still 
fails with stack overflow. 

[LLDB](https://lldb.llvm.org/) shows that Iterators occupy too much space on the stack. I replaced them with a for 
loop. It’s still not good enough. The question is, should I continue to look for a way to optimize the amount of 
branches, or should I look for a completely new approach.

Ok. The way to reduce branches is to pass a reference to the current best, and if the current path produces greater 
value, then there is no sense in continuing. The algorithm gives a correct result on test data and finishes on actual 
data with the result `1044`,  but `That's not the right answer; your answer is too high. Curiously, it's the right 
answer for someone else; you might be logged in to the wrong account or just unlucky`. Yes. That's who I am. Unlucky :)

In the current implementation, I am getting the `current_best` from the path only when the algorithm is on the last 
tile because of caching, which happens only a few initial times. At the same time, the cache contains the missing part 
of the calculation. I can improve that part while thinking about fixing the errors.

While updating that thing, I have one more idea regarding `current_best` instead of `usize::MAX` I can use the worst 
case, which is the longest path times the highest tile value. Where the longest past is the length of 
`(side 1 + side 2) * 9`. 

That made the test fail. This makes me think that `current_best` and caching prevent us from visiting some tiles. 
Without cache, everything is too slow, so I am back to the same question - should I continue looking for a way to 
optimize the number of branches, or should I look for a completely new approach? Looks like optimizing branches is not 
as easy as I hoped. It’s time to get off the keyboard and think of a new approach. 

The best idea I come up with so far is to unroll recursion. I will do that and see how it goes.

I am not smart enough to unroll that recursion. Instead, I’ll try to do some kind of `Dijkstra's algorithm`. Here is 
what the rough idea looks like. Initialize the visited vector with `None`. Mark the start index as Some(0). For every 
`visited tile`we get all `unvisited neighbors` with a list of values from `visited tiles`. For every 
`unvisited neighbor`, we get the lowest value from the list and put the sum of that value and the value of the current 
tile to the visited vector. The lowest value at the end will be the shortest distance.

The first iteration comes close to an actual value but is not good enough. Best guess when `unvisited neighbor` has 
`visited` ones that have the same value, `11` and `11`, for example, I do not know which one to choose, so I am 
choosing the first one. That will impact the route later because of the `rule of three` from the task.

Let's zoom out a bit. 

```Plain Text
1 2 3 4 5
2 2 3 4 5
3 2 3 4 5
4 2 3 4 5
5 2 3 4 5
```

Consider how I can get to the tile (3,3):

- (0,3) E (1,3) E (2,3) E (3,3) from E with 3 E
- (1,2) S (1,3) E (2,3) E (3,3) from E with 2 E
- (2,1) S (2,2) S (2,3) E (3,3) from E with 1 E
- (3,0) S (3,1) S (3,2) S (3,3) from S with 3 S
- ...

This means my node looks like this:
`(x,y, direction_from_where_we_got_here, amount_of_steps_to_the_same_direction) -> distance`. 

It took me some time to make it work. But in the end, I have two steps. First - building a graph. Second, implement a 
good enough `Dijkstra algorithm` to find the shortest path on that graph. It can be better. But it is good enough 
already.

Part two required building a slightly different graph, which was hard because of a New Year celebration.

Happy New Year, BTW.

## [Day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/18)

Part one was relatively easy to build since I had already built most moving parts (Map, Directions).

The current map expansion is way too slow for part two. 

Ok. I made it faster. Now, I am running out of memory. Even if I use `u8` instead of `char` as my tile, it still tries 
to allocate more than 150 gigs of RAM. 

There should be a formula to calculate the area of a polygon. 

It turned out there is [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) with straightforward 
implementation. 

The answer is `too low`. Hmmm.

It gives almost the expected result on test data:

- 952404941483
- 952408144115

I suspect the Shoelace formula does not account for the 'trench', which should be our perimeter. 

No. It is too big. 

Can it be half of it? It is. Almost. I don't know why (I am too sleepy to figure it out), but the difference between 
the Shoelace formula result and the expected area is `perimeter / 2 + 1`. 

## [Day 19](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/19)

Part one has complicated rules to encode. And maybe I over-engineered it a bit.

The same is true for part two. Even after I wrapped my head around what needed to be done, keeping all requirements in 
mind was hard. Proper naming helps a lot. 

## [Day 20](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/20)

It is this kind of day; tests are green, but the result on actual data is `too low`. 

I don't see any obvious error and am too sleepy to continue looking. 

Yep. That was a bug in parsing. Let’s see what’s in part two.

Part two always starts with "I can brute force through it.” Didn't work this time.

While looking at various debug outputs, I noticed a pattern:

```Plain Text
button press# 3778, origin: 7, value: High
button press# 3888, origin: 28, value: High
button press# 3906, origin: 53, value: High
button press# 4050, origin: 38, value: High
button press# 7557, origin: 7, value: High
button press# 7777, origin: 28, value: High
button press# 7813, origin: 53, value: High
button press# 8101, origin: 38, value: High
button press# 11336, origin: 7, value: High
```

I need all those origins to be High at the same button press. Which looks like a task for the `LCM`. I will check it 
out tomorrow.

Yeah. I was on the right track yesterday. With one caveat, the answer is an `LCM` of button presses amount. The count 
should start from 1, not from 0.

# [Day 21](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/21)

The first part was straightforward to brute force. Just flip tiles on the map and then count the values. 

In part two, it was obvious from the beginning that the growing map would not fit the memory. 

First Idea. I will have a queue where I will push back the next positions on the map and pop front positions that I 
need to calculate on the current step.

Hm. It gives me more positions that I need. Oh. Oh. One point gives four possible points on the next step. Each point
on the next step will return to the previous point. And I need only one of those. I can't figure out anything smarter 
than a HashSet.

It takes too long to compute 1000 steps on test data. I need to figure out if the result has a repeating pattern. The 
result is growing with each step. The rate of growth is also growing. What about that rate?

There is a pattern. Starting from step 39, the second derivative is `2` on test data in every eleventh step. 

```Plain Text
39: 944 d: 50, d2: 2
40: 989 d: 45, d2: -5
41: 1053 d: 64, d2: 19
42: 1107 d: 54, d2: -10
43: 1146 d: 39, d2: -15
44: 1196 d: 50, d2: 11
45: 1256 d: 60, d2: 10
46: 1324 d: 68, d2: 8
47: 1383 d: 59, d2: -9
48: 1464 d: 81, d2: 22
49: 1528 d: 64, d2: -17
50: 1594 d: 66, d2: 2
51: 1653 d: 59, d2: -7
52: 1735 d: 82, d2: 23
53: 1805 d: 70, d2: -12
54: 1853 d: 48, d2: -22
55: 1914 d: 61, d2: 13
56: 1988 d: 74, d2: 13
57: 2072 d: 84, d2: 10
58: 2145 d: 73, d2: -11
59: 2244 d: 99, d2: 26
60: 2324 d: 80, d2: -19
61: 2406 d: 82, d2: 2
62: 2479 d: 73, d2: -9
63: 2579 d: 100, d2: 27
64: 2665 d: 86, d2: -14
65: 2722 d: 57, d2: -29
66: 2794 d: 72, d2: 15
67: 2882 d: 88, d2: 16
68: 2982 d: 100, d2: 12
69: 3069 d: 87, d2: -13
70: 3186 d: 117, d2: 30
71: 3282 d: 96, d2: -21
72: 3380 d: 98, d2: 2
```

And while all other values are all over the place, the sum of the second derivatives of those ten steps is always 16. 
There are two problems. While I can eyeball it, I can't come up with a way to detect such a pattern, and most 
importantly - I am still trying to figure out how that can help me solve my problem. 

The map from the test input is square, and eleven is the length of a side.

Before I think about how that can help me and then how to detect such a pattern, I want to check if such a pattern even 
exists on real input.

I can not eyeball it on 1000 steps. After adding grouping by the second derivative, the pattern is visible there.
Starting from step 132, `0` repeats every 131 steps. 131 is the length of a side in the actual input. Looks like this 
is the way to detect a pattern. Get a side length, and iterate through the steps until a second derivative is repeated.

Let's figure out what to do with it tomorrow.

It has been a long time since I wrote the previous sentence. I got sick and was in bed without any energy to continue. 
Now, I hope I am back to pre-sickness performance levels. Let’s figure out what’s left. 

131 does not help at all. 26501365 - is the number of steps. It is not divisible by 131. 26501365 - 133 is also not 
divisible by 131. So yeah, while there is a pattern, I do not see how it can help me.

I was playing a bit with numbers. IDK if that has a meaning but **2023**00 * 131 + 65 = 26501365

```Plain Text
65 + 131 * 0 = 3_917
65 + 131 * 1 = 34_920
65 + 131 * 2 = 96_829
65 + 131 * 3 = 189_644
65 + 131 * 4 = 313_365
65 + 131 * 5 = 467_992
```

Does it make any sense?

It does. Oh boy, it does. d1 - first derivative. d2 - second derivative.

```Plain Text
N     Value       d1         d2
0    3_917
1    34_920      31_003
2    96_829      61_909     30_906
3    189_644     92_815     30_906           
```

This means I can use simple math to calculate needed values like that.

```Plain Text
1: 3_917 + 31_003 + 30_906 * 0 = 34_920
2: 34_920 + 31_003 + 30_906 * 1 = 96_829
3: 96_829 + 31_003 + 30_906 * 2 = 189_644
4: 189_644 + 31_003 + 30_906 * 3 = 313_365
5: 313_365 + 31_003 + 30_906 * 4 = 467_992
```

Now I need to repeat that 202300  times. Easy.

As an afterword, I can say that time I spent on Advent of Code was well spent. I had a lot of fun, and I am looking 
forward to the next one.

Last year, I found the European Divide Trail website, and I have been thinking about it since. It is time to think 
about it seriously. 

[EDT](https://europeandividetrail.com/) is a bicycle trail that is 7,600 km long. It starts in Norway and ends in 
Portugal. I will only be able to do part of it. It requires at least 32 days, 6 hours, and 28 minutes 
([current record](https://europeandividetrail.com/2022/08/18/finisher-5/)), and since I am not in a record-breaking 
business, I will need at least five times more time. I do not have that much time. What I have is two weeks.

Two weeks, minus the time for the flight there and back, and minus two days for packing and unpacking. This gives me 
ten full riding days. 

The first few sections of EDT are primarily flat. I can enjoy riding around 100km per day. All my previous experience 
says that the daily distance budget should include 20% exploring tax. That gives me 80 km per day, or 800 in total. 

There is an airport in Kirkines, Norway, which is 60 km from the start point. All flights there are from 8 to 20 hours, 
which sucks. I can’t bring a gas canister with me on a plane. Without it, I can’t cook. Google does not know about 
shops in the airport area, but in Kirkines city, I found four. This means I must arrive in the Kirkines early in the 
morning, assemble the bike, ride to the town (12 km), buy everything I need, and ride back to the camping spot. That 
will be a tough day. 

The next big question is how to get my bike there. There are a few options that I am aware of:

- Specialized bicycle delivery companies. The price varies from 200 to 300 euros. If I understand it correctly, they 
do everything. I just pay. 
- Deutsche Post. You can send your bicycle across Europe for 60 euros if I read it correctly. You also need to pack it 
by yourself 
([box on Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Fahrradkarton-verpackung-1600-DHL-Versand-TopQualit%C3%A4t/dp/B017RPXJ12)). 
What I did not get is the delivery address. Will it wait for me in the post office, or do I need to rent some storage 
room? I will keep googling.
- Bring it with me on an airplane. It is a very straightforward option, and in most air companies, it costs as one 
additional piece of luggage. One caveat, however. On some random thread, I read a story about how an airline lost 
bikes in connection to Kirkines, and guys spent half of their vacation in Kirkines waiting for their bikes. 

¯\_(ツ)_/¯

I prefer to send my bike by post in advance and then collect it on arrival. And if that is not possible, I’ll fall 
back to the airplane option. 

Ok, let’s say I and my bike survived the flight there. I need a destination. Preferably an airport around 800 km away. 
And there are two. 

- Oulu, Finland - [828 km](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1411423407). 
- Luleå, Sweeden - [723 km](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1419651055).

For no particular reason (it is shorter), I like the Luleå option more. On the other hand, Oulu is a bigger city, so 
it would be easier to find a bike box to pack my bicycle for the flight back. On the other hand, going to Sweden means 
that I’ll cover more EDT.  I need to spend more time on the map to decide. And have a few months for that.

## Gear

I need a warmer sleeping bag. I froze on my [Turkey adventure](https://barhamon.com/post/tet_turkey_ride.html) and do 
not want it to happen again. After reading hundreds of reviews, I settled on a 
[Western Mountaineering Megalite](https://www.westernmountaineering.com/product/megalite/). Also, I imagine myself 
riding the whole day and falling asleep without a proper shower. A sleeping bag liner is a good idea.

Since I’ll do it in summer, and at least half of my way is above the Arctic Circle (how cool is that!?), it will be 
bright 24/7. Maybe I need to bring night shades instead of a headlamp. 

Fishing is allowed in Finland and Sweden. When I think about grilled fish, I want to bring fishing gear. Will I have 
the time and energy to do it? I don’t know. But that shorter route to Luleå does look more tempting now. I must figure 
out how to strap my fishing rod to a bike. 

I have two saddlebags. They hold all my gear. I need to buy an additional frame bag for tools and spare parts, a 
handlebar bag for quick access things (snacks), and a packable backpack for emergency storage. IDK about the last one, 
but have a feeling that I need it.

I also plan to get to the shop and pay a mechanic to watch me maintain my bike with the tools I will bring. In theory, 
I should be able to get away with [leatherman signal](https://www.leatherman.com/de_DE/signal-439.html), 
[Blackburn Big Switch Ratchet Multi-Tool](https://www.blackburndesign.com/p/big-switch-ratchet-bike-multi-tool/350160000100000027.html), 
tube patch kit, pump, spare tube, zip ties and duck tape. 

I read much info on solar panels, hub chargers, etc., and ultimately, I decided to bring two power banks with me. It 
should be enough to get me to the place with electricity to charge them back. All countries I’ll pass have the same 
standard electrical outlet, so I need only one charger.

Thousands of lakes and rivers are on my way from which I can filter my drinking water. So I do not need to worry about 
water. Food-wise, there is a grocery store every 150-200 km, which means I must be able to carry three days worth of 
food on my bike. Maybe I need that packable backpack after all. 

Do not forget a rope to hang my food bag!

## 17.02.2024 UPDATE

After talking to people, there is a few updates. First of all, I can try to find a shop in Kirkines and ask them if I 
can send them bike in advance. They will keep it for me, and I will pick it up when I arrive. I have not found a bike 
shop though. 

And the second is a gear list update. It lacks a few important things.

- Knife
- First aid kit
- Sunscreen
- Insect repellent

Which now are in the list.

tags:
- webpack

Recently I had a task - add cache busters in the existing React project.

It is pretty straightforward - open webpack config, add [contenthash(:number)] to output.filename, and that's it.

Give me a sec, I said, and open my IDE.

But that was not so easy because links to resulting js files were hardcoded to ejs templates. ExpressJS serve those 
templates because some variables should be inserted there on request time.

My first thought was to throw everything out and rewrite it with proper SSR. But that would take more time than I can 
afford on that task.

o what I need is to somehow add links to templates by Webpack. And HtmlWebpackPlugin, with the help of raw-loader, can 
do that.

-----

First of all, make sure that HtmlWebpackPlugin and raw-loader are installed in the project.

```bash
npm install html-webpack-plugin raw-loader --save-dev
```

Then we will tell HtmlWebpackPlugin to get our existing templates, add there links to assets, live rest as it is, and 
save as new templates for the ExpressJS server.

```typescript
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    admin: './src/admin.js',
    user: './src/user.js',
  },
  output: {
    filename: '[name].[contenthash:6].js',
    path: resolve(__dirname, 'public'),
  },
  optimization: { ...  },
  module: { ... },
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      // path where new template with injected links will be stored
      filename: '../views/dist/admin.ejs',
      // path to old template
      // notise !!raw-loader! before path thats where magic is happened
      template: '!!raw-loader!./views/admin.ejs',
      // public path where our assets will be avalable
      publicPath: "/",
      // in order to add chunks only for the required entry points
      chunks: ['admin'],
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      filename: '../views/dist/user.ejs',
      template: '!!raw-loader!./views/user.ejs',
      publicPath: "/",
      chunks: ['user'],
    })
  ],
};
```

I hope it helps you next time you feel the urge to rewrite everything.

To not only increase entropy but also be useful, this blog should be indexed by search engines. And to make it easier 
for search engines to index, they came up with robots.txt and sitemap.

!!
sitemap.xml - a list of pages that can be downloaded. Optionally you can specify how often the page is refreshed and 
when was the last time, but as far as I know, the optional parameters are ignored. More details can be found 
[here](https://www.sitemaps.org/).

robots.txt - instructions for robots. In our case, we simply indicate the path from where to get the sitemap. More 
details can be found [here](https://www.robotstxt.org/).
!!

For our site to produce sitemap.xml, create a sitemap.xml.tsx file in the pages folder:

```typescript
// /pages/sitemap.xml.tsx
import { PostInterface, posts } from "../data/posts";
import React from "react";

//Change this to your site url.
const POST_URL_PREFIX = 'https://barhamon.com/post/';

function createSitemap(posts: PostInterface[]) {
  return `<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
    ${posts.map(({ pid }) => `<url><loc>${POST_URL_PREFIX}${pid}</loc></url>`).join('')}
    </urlset>`;
}

export async function getServerSideProps({ res }) {
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/xml');
  res.write(createSitemap(Object.values(posts)));
  res.end();

  //Don't forget this line, even if it seems useless.
  //Without it NextJs will be complaining about:
  //TypeError: Cannot convert undefined or null to object
  return { props: {} };
}

const Sitemap: React.FC = () => (<></>)

export default Sitemap;

```

In the public folder, create the robots.txt file:

```bash
User-agent: *
Sitemap: https://barhamon.com/sitemap.xml
```

As usual, all the code on the [GitHub](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon). If you find a mistake, or you know how to do

Hey!

You can now subscribe to this blog :)

Yeah, I planned to add this feature a long time ago, and finally, today, I got a couple of hours to do it. After some 
googling, I found [JSON feed](https://jsonfeed.org/). I do not want to start the "FINALLY! THE RSS KILLER" thread, but 
I am happy because I do not like XML. It is wordy and not readable for me.

Newerless RSS feeds are widely supported, so this blog should provide a new and shiny JSON feed and an old and dusty 
RSS.

If you read the ["How to serve sitemap.xml with Next.JS"](/post/How_to_serve_sitemap_xml_with_Next_JS) post, then it 
should be familiar to you. Here are links to the source code of 
[feed.json.tsx](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/9f87a27d4324f9d6f8e284a43ce8c1de5eb3951d/pages/feed.json.tsx) 
and [feed.xml.tsx.](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/9f87a27d4324f9d6f8e284a43ce8c1de5eb3951d/pages/feed.xml.tsx)

One significant difference is memoization. Since posts are immutable, we can remember the result of feed generation. 
I wrote a simple helper function for that. It is not a general-purpose memoization function because it will only work 
with a one-argument function and make only shallow comparisons. This is intentional and done for simplicity's sake. 
You can find the source code here 
[utils/index.ts](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/67ef55743382bdc152a901211434fe0895b6cff0/utils/index.ts).

It was a long time ago, and I couldn’t write anything longer than would fit in a toot. It is weird because that was my
first conference, and it felt awesome to be one of two hundred geeks who truly care about their craft. I enjoyed the
entire experience.

The workshop part was awesome (I ran out of positive adjectives). In the first session, I developed my shell, which can
execute commands, change the current directory, and perform basic logic and grouping. In the second session, I created
a TUI chat client using RatatUI. I had a great time working on them. The workshops were the best part of the
conference, and I really look forward to the next one.

!! Should I make shell and chat TUI public?
! github
I don’t think so. Most importantly, I don’t intend to support or improve them, at least not for now.
!!

Then, there were two days of cool presentations. I haven’t taken any notes, and looking back, I see that they would
help me write this post. On the other hand, I wouldn’t have enjoyed the presentations as much if I had been distracted
by note-taking. So yeah, no regrets.

In the opening presentation, [Tim Clicks](https://mastodon.nz/@timClicks) talked about ways to improve software
quality. One of the techniques he mentioned was fuzing. At home I scrolled through the photo roll and found the library
name he was using.

!! Pictures
! image
I took some technical pictures to remember the talks, which proved helpful. However, I don’t think it’s a good idea to
share those pictures. I haven’t asked the people in those images for permission to share them, and I’m too lazy
to gather their permissions.
!!

I maintain a markdown flavor/parser. This blog uses it, and I know one more person who at least tried to use it. Hi
Augustin 🖖. I wouldn’t say that it’s a battle-tested piece of software, but it’s pretty solid and has never panicked
on me. It has 100% code coverage and is written in Rust (by the way, TM). I am telling you all that not to brag about
how cool it is (maybe a little) but to illustrate my confidence in it. I was very confident that YAMD had no obvious
bugs. And you know what? Cargo-fuzz library found three bugs in less than a second. I’m very impressed and highly
recommend incorporating fuzing into your workflow.

!! cargo-fuzz
! rust
Has all the bells and whistles you can imagine. Check out the
[Rust Fuzz Book](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/cargo-fuzz.html) for more details. It is totally worth it.
!!

One of the most unexpected and positive outcomes for me was the one I got from Cooking Parsers with Winnit by
[Santiago Fraire Willemoes](https://woile.dev/). His story about creating a new language to describe cooking recipes
inspired me to keep working on YAMD. It’s not that I lacked inspiration to do so, but at times it felt pointless. There
are plenty of markdown parsers and flavors available. I could use one of them, as I always have, and it would be
perfectly fine. Seeing in person that I’m not the only one reinventing the wheel adds meaning to the whole enterprise.
I don’t know how that works.

!! recipe-lang
! github
Check out [https://github.com/reciperium/recipe-lang](https://github.com/reciperium/recipe-lang) if you are into
recipes!  
!!

Unfortunately, I didn’t have the time and energy to explore the city, but the venue was a 20-minute walk from my hotel.
I experienced enough of Florence to be certain that I will return someday. And, as a note to myself, next time I should
take at least one day before and after conference. It was tough with traveling.

I needed to add code highlighting to posts (no one likes ugly code :).

A quick googling showed that for my stack there is nothing ready. But everything revolves around Prismjs.

!!
The guys from FormidableLabs with [prism-react-renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer) came 
closest to what I need. But I want to figure it out myself.
!!

!! update #1
to reduce js bundle size you can use [babel-plugin-prismjs](https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/babel-plugin-prismjs). With 
this babel plugin you can bundle only languages you need.

You can find usage example [here](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/f0cb751604c5fc90b2dd679a6b1f96705b1a2bc3/.babelrc)
!!

### If you didn’t come here for details:

Step 1:

```bash
yarn add prismjs
yarn add @types/prismjs -D
```

Step # 2:

in pages / _app.tsx add

```typescript
import 'prismjs/themes/prism-tomorrow.css';
```

step # 3:

Create the Code component

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, ReactNode, useState } from "react";
import Prism, { Token } from "prismjs";

export interface CodeProps {
  language: 'js' | 'css' | 'json' | 'jsx' | 'typescript' | 'yml' | 'Rust' | 'bash',
  children: string
}

function tokenToReactNode(token: Token | string, i: number): ReactNode {
  if (typeof token === "string") {
    return <span key={i}>{token}</span>
  } else if (typeof token.content === "string") {
    return (<span key={i} className={`token ${token.type}`}>{token.content}</span>)
  } else if (Array.isArray(token.content)) {
    return <span key={i} className={`token ${token.type}`}>{token.content.map(tokenToReactNode)}</span>
  } else {
    return (<span key={i} className={`token ${token.type}`}>{tokenToReactNode(token.content, 0)}</span>)
  }
}

export const Code: React.FC<CodeProps> = ({ language, children }) => {
  const [data, replaceToken] = useState< Array<string | Token>>([])
  useEffect(() => {
      import(`prismjs/components/prism-${language}`).then(() => {
        const tokens: Array<string | Token> = Prism.languages[ language ]
          ? Prism.tokenize(children, Prism.languages[ language ])
          : [];
        replaceToken(tokens)
      })
  }, [children]);

  return (
    <pre className={`language-${language}`}>
      {data.length ? data.map(tokenToReactNode) : children}
    </pre>
  );
}

```

### And now the details:

In the first step, we add the prismjs library and types to it in the project.

In the second step, we add a theme. The prismjs library already has several themes and we use one of them. You can 
choose which one you like here: node_modules/prismjs/themes. Also, on the library website, you can choose from about a 
million more.

In the third step, we create the component itself, this time with comments.

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, ReactNode, useState } from "react";
import Prism, { Token } from "prismjs";

export interface CodeProps {
  //Prismjs supports a lot more languages. The entire list can be found on the site,
  //this is a list of those languages that will be useful to me.
  language: 'js' | 'css' | 'json' | 'jsx' | 'typescript' | 'yml' | 'Rust' | 'bash',
  children: string
}

//We will use the tokenize method (https://prismjs.com/docs/Prism.html#.tokenize).
//Because other API methods directly manipulate DOM, and that’s not what we want.
//tokenToReactNode is our function that converts the result of executing tokenize into react components.
function tokenToReactNode(token: Token | string, i: number): ReactNode {
  if (typeof token === "string") {
    return <span key={i}>{token}</span>
  } else if (typeof token.content === "string") {
    return (<span key={i} className={`token ${token.type}`}>{token.content}</span>)
  } else if (Array.isArray(token.content)) {
    return <span key={i} className={`token ${token.type}`}>{token.content.map(tokenToReactNode)}</span>
  } else {
    return (<span key={i} className={`token ${token.type}`}>{tokenToReactNode(token.content, 0)}</span>)
  }
}

export const Code: React.FC<CodeProps> = ({ language, children }) => {
  //In the state, we store the code and tokens for the code.
  const [data, replaceToken] = useState<Array<string | Token>>([])
  useEffect(() => {
      //We need to add languages since, by default only markup, CSS, clike, and javascript are available.
      //I did not find a better way, like the one below, if you know - please submit an issue.
      import(`prismjs/components/prism-${language}`).then(() => {
        //If language still not available skip tokenize part
        const tokens: Array<string | Token> = Prism.languages[ language ]
          ? Prism.tokenize(children, Prism.languages[ language ])
          : [];
        //Save the result to the state.
        replaceToken( tokens )
      }, [children])
  });
  //If the array with tokens is empty, print the code from props, otherwise render our beauty.
  return (
    <pre className={`language-${language}`}>
      {data.length ? data.map(tokenToReactNode) : children}
    </pre>
  );
}

And moving here was the second-best decision in my life.The first one was moving from Moscow to Kyiv in December of 
2013. A lot of people said back then that we were crazy. And to be honest, I also had doubts at that time. It looked 
like we were abandoning rich Moscow for no reason. Then Russia annexed Crimea. Then tried to annex Donbas and Luhansk 
regions. And now 8, years later, it launched a full-scale assault against Ukraine.

![My granddad is the best fishing partner](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650031459/a-year/fishing_with_granddad.jpg)

My mom and grandparents are still in Ukraine. Fortunately, there is nothing important in the area where they live, so 
there are no fights. And I hope it will stay that way. Even though on every call, my mom says everything is okay, life 
in the war-torn country is still tough. But at least banks are working, so money is not a problem.

![Waiting for plane in Moscow Domodedovo airport](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650031788/a-year/waiting_for_a_plane_to_kyiv.jpg)

A year ago, we thought that after a year of living here, we would decide if we like to stay or we will come back to 
Kyiv. To be fair, Mari has been living here for only half a year, but now that does not matter. Russia proved once 
again that you could not be far enough. So yeah, we are staying. Good thing that before moving, we had time to 
consider all the options, and we still did not change our minds. We like Munich. Yes, it is an expensive place to 
live, but comfortable, safe, and cozy.

![Everything you do in Germany involves beer](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650032133/a-year/german_course_schedule.jpg)

I started to learn German. I cannot say that it is a huge success, but there are some. The main problem is vocabulary, 
and I do not have the mental capacity to do something about it. I know I should. Check24 pays for it, so I did not 
choose the school. Because of that, I can not say if Goethe institute is the best choice. But I like it. The teachers 
are good. The group is small. And by happy coincidence, the class I am attending is 10 minutes walking distance from 
home.

!!
! meh
Some days ago, during a pause between learning sessions, we went to the kitchen to drink water. Small talk, usual 
subjects like weather, sports, and the stock market. My turn to say something about my investment strategy.

- I do not have one. Every time I get a long-term life plan - Russia invades.

Dude from Syria:

- I feel you, bro. I feel you.
!!

In January, finally I bought a bicycle. Since then, it has been my primary way of commuting. I feel like I am fitter 
and happier than before. One downside is I usually write my blog posts on the way to/from work, and you know, it is 
hard to write while you are cycling.

![Cycling is fun](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650032311/a-year/bicycle.jpg)

While I still like motorcycling more than cycling, I do not think I will be riding a motorcycle anytime soon. My 
driver's license was valid only first six months, and there is no easy way to exchange a driver's license issued in 
Ukraine for a German one. The process is time-consuming, and this year's priority is the language. So yeah, I accepted 
no motorcycle reality and started to plan cycling trips.

![We actually a big team](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650032501/a-year/team.jpg)

There are no big work-related changes. My productivity dropped significantly because it is hard to pull yourself from 
the doom scrolling. But management is supportive, and I am grateful for that. I did a big presentation on why 
functional React matters. I want to turn it into a blog post, but I can not find the time. Also, we are trying to come 
up with migration to typescript strategy. The big picture looks like that: The first step is to write all the new 
stuff using TS, which we do already. Next is to convert all our internal packages, which we will start soon. And then 
convert all our applications. Sounds easier than it is. 

![view from the balcony](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650032671/a-year/the_flat.jpg)

We are living in the same flat. Maybe twice a month I check [immoscout](https://www.immobilienscout24.de/) for a new 
potential flat/house. But now, with the language courses so close to our current apartment, it is even harder to find 
a good enough substitute to justify the hustle of moving. Also, we spent a weekend in the mountain cabin. And now we 
want that instead apartment in the city, which is even harder to find in our budget. Living outside the city will mean 
that we need a car, which is not possible for now because of the driver's license issue. So I think we will live in 
that flat for some foreseeable future. Ah. The “housemaster” finally replaced our paper doorbell tags with a proper 
ones. But they misspelled our surnames. I am not sure how big of an issue that is, but since there is no moving out, 
I think that we should do something about that.

![almost all social interactions outside workplace looks like that](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650032745/a-year/social_life.jpg)

Social life is getting better. Since COVID restrictions are dropped, more people socialize within the office. We even 
go to Creta. I mean the insurance part of the company, which are 100+ people. Also, I met some lovely people in my 
German course. And we are planning some hikes and beer drinking activities.

![can't believe i have to protest this shit](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1650032862/a-year/cant_believe_i_have_to_protest_this_shit.jpg)

A big part of life now is helping refugees to find a way to live everyday life and participating in anti-war/Russia 
protests. What amazes me the most is how many people care. Every day I meet a random person who does something good. 
I thought that there were more good people than bad people, and now I have proof.

In one of the first posts, I promised to post the music here. This time has come.

I have a Telegram channel where I have been posting music for quite some time for my friends. The first step is to 
move all the entries I already posted there. It is pretty simple to download the channel archive from telegram. And, 
because I can, I wrote some tools on Rust to convert data to a format my blog will understand, upload images, and so 
on.

!!
! microchip
If you are interested in code, check those GitHub repos: 
[telegram-post-converter](https://github.com/Lurk/telegram-post-converter) and 
[Cloudinary SDK](https://github.com/Lurk/cloudinary_rs). Maybe I will make an effort to make something resembling a 
crate from the Cloudinary SDK repo.
!!

The second step is translating old descriptions into English, checking for broken links, and so on. This is a work in 
progress. You can already check the stuff here: [music](/tag/music). I wouldn’t say I like how it looks, so expect 
some change in design.

I also think about implementing [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/) as part of a migration to Rust. But it took 
me two years to start migrating my music posts here, so no promises.

For five years, I've been working as a system architect in a startup. We did some cool things because we were small 
and agile. That was fun and challenging, so I spend all my time there. And I mean it. Even if I was with my wife, 
riding my motorcycle, fishing, or you name it - I was building the next feature or designing a new product or 
debugging some nasty bug in my mind.

So, I burned out.

I heard a lot about people burning out but never think of me in that context. It did not happen overnight. That took 
half a year or maybe a full year to build up. Like very slow dementor was sucking out all the fun in the world. In the 
end, besides my growing grumpiness, I started to close in inside myself. That was bad not only for my work but, most 
importantly, for my relationship.

Because it was a slow process, I did not notice it right away. But when I did, I spoke with my wife and described 
everything about how I feel. Together we decided that it is time to go to the psychiatrist. And that was the right 
decision at the right time.

My options were to keep going and take medications or quit and rest. So, for the first time since 17, I am unemployed. 
For a while, I do everything that makes me happy ([that will be another post](/post/the_fun_stuff)).

If you are reading this because you feel that the dementor has caught you:

The most valuable advice that I can give to you - seek professional help.

Second most valuable advice - speak with close ones. It will help a lot.

I`ve made another short trip — two days of tarmac, gravel, and sand roads. I deliberately avoid highways, as much as I
can, because all the fun and beauty are on small and hidden trails. It always amazed me where people can live. To some
villages, the only path is through deep sand trails.

Here are tracks for the [first](https://scenicapp.space/ride/UHlOhOsM) and

I did not bring a tent with this time but got a hammock and slept with a terrific view

My first rust app that works and does something useful.

What does it do?

Have you ever pasted a link in messenger and deleted all those fbclid, utm_source, utm_campaign, utm_medium GET params by hands? Clink does that for you. It sits quietly in the background, and if you copy a link to the clipboard, Clink automatically removes those params for you.

Inspiration for this project was this [tweet](https://twitter.com/ftrain/status/1359138516681314311?s=21). And yes, Clink has "your mom" mode :)

If you are interested, here is the link to the [Clink GitHub repo](https://github.com/Lurk/clink). And if you are not interested in reading source codes, [here](https://github.com/Lurk/clink/releases) you can download the latest version of Clink for your operating system (macOS, Linux, Windows).

Usage is pretty straightforward:

```bash
clink [OPTIONS]
    Options:
    -v, --verbose Be verbose.
    -m, --mode Mode of Clink. Available "remove" and "your_mom" modes (default: Remove)
    -h, --help Show this help message.
```

I learned a few things along the way and some things I want to learn in the near future. Like is it ok to thread::sleep, or there is a better way. Or how to automatically build deb and dmg? And so on.

So yeah, stay tuned to more Rust content :)

Now with a memory leak 🎉

Since my first [mention](/post/clink) of it, I've made a lot of changes. If you interested in changelog you can look at the [releases](https://github.com/Lurk/clink/releases) page.

But most important thing that I noticed is a memory leak. To be completely honest, I am not sure if there is a memory leak, but it looks there is. So yeah, I noticed that after couple of weeks clink process consumes more than 600mb of RAM. I found it wrong because this is a small app, and my expectation is that it should be less than a megabyte.

I still did not find the time to do a proper analysis what is going on. So far, I have a couple of theories :

- I am so “talented” that even languages with “memory safe“ selling point are leaking in my hands. 
- There is something that I don't know about how memory allocation works on Mac OS
- I am using the ,[clipboard@0.5.0](https://crates.io/crates/clipboard/0.5.0), crate, and the leak is there.

I read a couple of blog post about how to approach tasks like that, and it feels like takes couple of days😔

And one more thing™ - when I packed my stuff, I noticed that I am running low on T-shirts. And guess what? Now I have the clink T-Shirt. At first, I did not liked it. I mean printing quality was not that impressive, but the longer I have it, more I like it. Maybe, when I will have time or inspiration there will be 1.1 version of it. Right now I do not know why you will want one, but if you do - drop me a message.

As you can see in my previous posts, I like photography.

Not like I am particularly good at that, but I enjoy seeing those moments later. That brings me to CDN's because those photos should be stored and delivered.

After some googling, I choose Cloudinary because it has some nice features and a decent free plan - 25000 transformations or 25 GB storage or 25 GB bandwidth monthly.

!! More free stuff for me
! link
I will receive more free services for every registered user. So if you like my photos, go on, click on that link, and register. [That link](https://cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/hqd3swadmblfw3ivxjmv)
!!

Cloudinary has a react library, but I did not find any image gallery. So here is how I did it.

After uploading images to Cloudinary servers, I tag them. After that, I fetch the list of photos by this URL:

```typescript
`https://res.cloudinary.com/${your_username}/image/list/${tag}.json`
```

response type:

```typescript
interface CloudinaryTagResponse {
  resources: Array<{
    "public_id": string,
    "version": number,
    "format": string,
    "width": number,
    "height": number,
    "type": string,
    "created_at": string,
  }>,
  "updated_at": string,
}
```

Here is source code [cloudinary.tsx](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/blob/master/components/cloudinary.tsx) how I use it with [React Carousel Image Gallery](https://github.com/xiaolin/react-image-gallery)

If you look at lines 64 and 65, you will notice the **srcSet** and **sizes** field. You may ask how I calculate those params? I did not :)

I used the excellent [RespImageLint](https://github.com/ausi/respimage) tool created by Martin Auswöger.

In this post, you will learn how to add comments to your Next.js project. And it is easy with Disqus.

First, create an account on [Disqus](https://disqus.com/).

Second, go to the [https://disqus.com/profile/signup/intent/](https://disqus.com/profile/signup/intent/) and press "I want to install Disqus on my site", fill-up the form, and remember the short name (it will be useful later).

Third, install the [disqus-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/disqus-react) package from npm. If you are a Typescript user, this package already has typings.

```bash
npm install disqus-react
```

And use it like this:

```jsx
import { DiscussionEmbed } from "disqus-react"

<DiscussionEmbed
  shortname={"remember that short name from second step?"}
  config={{
    url: "this page url",
    identifier: "unique identifier of this page",
    title: "this page title"
  }}
/>

```

---

We did it following the Austrian section of the E5 route.Sometimes we diverged from the route, mainly because we decided to make that trip too late. People we meet on the way said they book everything from six to nine months in advance.

## First day

##### Oberstdorf to Rappensee hütte.

This is the first deviation from the original E5 route. We wanted to stay in Kemptner hütte, which is on the route, but it was booked out.

From the train station, we took bus number 7, which brought us to Alpe Eschbach. From there, we hiked to the Enzianhütte, where we had lunch. And after some rest and Radler, we walk to our destination. Overall it took us 6 or 7 hours. We drank too much beer celebrating the start of our trip, which ruined our next day. Don’t be like us. Two beers are more than enough.

At check-in, we upgraded from the common room to a room with four beds and a nice view from the window. The shower cost 4 euros for 3 minutes. There are only four cabins, so be aware of peak hours. Breakfast can be better, but it is an excellent hütte to spend a night or a couple of them.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_1}}

-----

## Second day

##### Resting day at Rappensee hütte.

First of all, I am happy that we added resting days when we planned this trip. We needed it, especially with a hangover.

That day we walked around the lake, took a nap after lunch, and walked a bit more around the hütte.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_2}}

-----

## Third day

##### Rappensee hütte to Stockach

Still not E5, but we are getting closer to it.

We were choosing between two ways. First is to go down to the valley and then take the bus to our guest house. The second is to get upper to the mountain and walk down almost to today's destination. Both start the same, so we decided to reach the point when the path splits and then choose. And we chose the first one because we saw a rockfall on the second. And that was a good decision. The track down is stunningly beautiful and looks like it is not very popular. On the way down, we met only three people, which was lovely. Only two of us and this majestic landscape.

We booked a tiny room in Petra House, and it was awesome. The host, Petra, was very hospitable. The room was small but cozy. The breakfast was excellent. And almost all of the four cats were hugged. Highly recommend.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_3}}

-----

## Fourth day

##### Stockach to Memminger hütte

We are finally back to the E5 track.

After our breakfast, the owner of our guest house said there was a bus that goes from Bach to the start of a trail to the hütte. And most importantly, they will ride us to that bus stop. The bus picked us up at 8:30 AM. The track up to the hütte is beautiful. Most of the way, it rained, so we were wet. When we almost reached the hütte, we saw wild goats. They were so close that it seemed like you could touch them.

We slept in a small cabin with ten other people. One of them was snoring so hard that the earth was shaking. The lesson is - always bring your earplugs with you.

The hot water for the shower costs 6 euros for 3 minutes. Cold water is free. There are only two showers, be aware of peak hours. The breakfast was good.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_4}}

-----

## Fifth day

##### Memminger hütte to Augsburger hütte.

This is not on E5. To stay on E5, you should go directly to Zams. I booked Augsburger hütte because I wanted to spend our eighth anniversary in the mountains, but Memminger hütte was booked out.

We did not make it. You should be in excellent physical and mental form for this track. I shit myself multiple times on the way. There are a few walls to climb, and when we saw the last one, we understood that it was well above our abilities. We turned around and headed down to the Zams. It was a long and physically demanding hike. We started at 7 am, saw the first human footprint around 6 pm, and got to the city at 11:40 pm. I do not think that I want to repeat that part of our adventure.

Having said all that, that was one of the most beautiful hikes I did. I never imagined I would be in a place like that one day. And again, we were alone the whole day, which is somehow a unique and precious thing for us—surrounded by mountains and wildlife. First time in my life, I saw a Weasel. He was curious and came close to us. That was something.

When we reached Zams, we booked the closest thing with a bed, and by happy coincidence, that turned out to be a lovely flat. We were sorry to wake everybody up to get our keys, but the alternative was to sleep on the bench in front of the house. I was ready to fall asleep right there, but Mari did not give up until we got the keys.

And boots! I do not know how many times I was thankful that we bought our boots on that day. I do not think we would have made it without them.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_5}}

-----

## Sixth day

##### Resting day at Zams.

I only got up from bed when I went to the grocery store to buy us breakfast and wine. That day was our eighth anniversary. We planned to spend it high in the mountains, but instead, we spent it lying in bed with muscle pain. I think that was the first time we celebrated this day like that.

We lived in Apartmenthaus Juen. The apartments are big, bright, and nicely furnished. Owners are friendly and helpful. Those apartments were also the most expensive accommodation we had on our route, but in our case, we had no other choice, and I am glad we spent our muscle pain day there.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_6}}

-----

## Seventh day

##### Zams to Moosanger.

We still did not fully recover from our previous hike, so we took a bus to the other side of the mountain. From there, we hiked to our next place to stay. On the way, we ate blueberries that grew right under our feet and picked enough mushrooms to cook dinner. When we reached our destination, the host drove us by car to the nearest grocery store, where we bought the missing ingredients for our dish.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_7}}

-----

## Eight day

##### Rest day at Moosanger.

The plan was to get to the summit we skipped yesterday. We even had early breakfast. But after it, we accidentally fall asleep. Luckily forest was across the street from our apartment, and after lunch, we did a short walk in it. I have never seen so many mushrooms as in this forest.

For those two nights, we booked apartments in Tiroler Hasenhöhle. They were good, so if you are searching for a place to stay in that area, I recommend checking them out.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_8}}

-----

## Ninth day

##### Moosanger to Tieflehn.

We walked through multiple villages to the MPrice supermarket at Wenns. There is a bus stop where you can hop on the 4204 bus that goes all the way to Tieflehn. At check-in, we received tickets for the cable car. We used them to get to Riffelseehütte, where we had lunch with an incredible view of the glacier we planned to reach the next day.

Our accommodation was Alpin Pension. I cannot complain.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_9}}

-----

## Tenth day

##### Tieflehn to Vent.

Our initial plan was to go from Tieflehn to Vent with the help of a bus that brings you to the other side of a glacier. Bus saves you at least 10km of walking around the glacier. We woke up at 5 am to start the hike at 6 am, but it was raining till 7 am. So we started later than we thought, which did not matter much because when we got to Braunschweiger hütte, we understood that we had enough walking for today.

The way up is pretty steep, and elevation starts to kick in. We met a guy from Nepal on the way. He was going in circles around us like it was nothing, which was funny if you consider that I was dying. Mahindra, if you are somehow reading this, it was nice to meet you there.

The view gets crazier the higher you get. When we finally reached the glacier, I was literally and figuratively high. And again, like multiple times on this trip, I never imagined that someday I would reach a place like that.

When we reached Braunschweig hütte, we were already tired and hungry. I don't know if that was the chief’s achievement or if our hike did the trick, but that was the best goulashsuppe I had eaten. While eating, we talked to a couple, and they advised us of a better way to get to the bus station.

We got down to the valley and reached Vent on a different bus. Everything was straightforward, except the 30 minutes late bus.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_10}}

-----

## Eleventh day

##### Rest day at Vent.

We got out the bad two times this day. One for breakfast and the second for dinner. Ah, we also washed our clothes.

Highly recommend the restaurant on the opposite side of the road from the church. The pizza, the pasta, the wine, everything was superb.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_11}}

-----

## Twelve day

##### Vent to Rifugio Similaun.

Because way up has a gentle angle, that was one of the easiest hikes on the trip. Despite the altitude gain and light rain, it was more like a walk in the park. The stunning one, with mountains covered with snow on both sides, waterfalls, and clouds that hug hills.

On the way to Rifugio Similaun, you can have lunch in Martin-Busch hütte. We had apple strudel and warm tea. Some people we met on the way said that Rifugio Similaun is much better than this one. I can not confirm nor deny that claim because we spend there half an hour. But I can say that Similaun is good.

First time on this trip, I had trouble sleeping. I woke up multiple times in the night with the feeling that there was not enough air in the room. Maybe that was the altitude effect, but we did not have the time to check this theory.

The hütte itself is excellent. I want to spend a few days there and explore the area. Somehow the shower information does not look so important as in the first days of our trip, but I will add it anyway. There is only one shower cabin, and hot water costs money. They do not have online booking, so you should call by phone to book a sleeping place. But even I could do that, and I hate phone calls.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_12}}

-----

## Thirteen day

##### Rifugio Similaun to Merano.

That was the last hiking day and the day with the nastiest weather. It started with snow, which gradually turned into rain. So yeah, one can say that we were blessed with the opportunity to compare hikes under the snow and the rain. I like snow more. When we reached the valley, the rain stopped, and we took the bus to Merano. The bus takes the scenic route, so be ready to enjoy the view.

In Merano, we booked a room in the Lux Garnì hotel (😎). It looks and smells like a nursing house, but the room is clean, the view from the balcony is gorgeous, and the breakfast is good. So, nothing to complain about.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_13}}

-----

## Fourteen day

##### Rest day at Merano.

Merano is a lovely city. We have not visited anything in the city. We just walked around, ate pizza and ice, drank wine, and sunbathed on the river bank. Everybody told us that we should visit thermals, but we did not do that either. So maybe sometime in the future, we will revisit it.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&e5_day_14}}

## Since I already received tons of questions, here is a small FAQ

##### Did I like it / would I do it again?

Yes. We think it was the best vacation we have had so far.

##### Was it hard?

As long as you do not diverge from the official E5 route, it is not that hard. And when you do diverge, check the path in advance to avoid surprises.

##### Do I need some special training beforehand?

I can not say that we live a particularly healthy and sporty life. So yeah, if you can survive a regular day hike - you can do it.

##### What about the gear?

There is no need to carry a sleeping bag with you. Every hütte provides enough blankets to sleep with comfort. What you need instead is the sleeping bag liner. It will save you weight and volume in your backpack.

While I saw people in the trail runners, we were glad we had our boots. So yeah, I would strongly recommend having proper boots, especially if you are planning detours.

I had flip-flops as camping shoes. You know, this kind that has a thing between your toes. It turned out that sometimes you want to wear warm socks. So yeah, next time I will bring something else.

Earplugs. Find ones that fit you before the trip, and thank me later.

##### Does it require two weeks?

No. It is one week trek. But, if you have time to enjoy the way and the places, I highly suggest you to take your time. I am personally glad that we did it in two weeks.

##### What would I change in our route?

For obvious reasons, I would skip Augsburger hütte and go directly to Zams.

There is no point in staying in Tieflehn. Instead, I would book a place in Braunschweiger hütte.

And last but not least I would like to spend more time in Rifugio Similaun. I like the place and the nature around worth exploring.

##### Have you used your shiny titanium shit shovel?

Yes. I highly recommend carrying one with you. It makes your life so much easier in critical situations.

I think that's it. We got the Crosser of the Alps achievement, and, I hope, you enjoyed the photos and the story.

This year was my turn to come up with a vacation plan. And guess what? This September, we will hike from Germany to Italy.

What is E5, you may ask? And that is a perfectly valid question because I did not know anything about this, or any other, route until this summer (thank you, Michele). So, E5 is one of the European long-distance hiking paths. It starts in Pointe du Raz, France, and ends in Venice, Italy. The length of the whole path is a whopping 3200 km. We will have only two weeks, and that is not enough to hike the entire route. That's why we will hike just the Austrian section, which is 175 km.

![base weight](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1661113048/e5_hike_preparations/actual_map.jpg)

Our way will start at Oberstdorf, Germany, and end in Merano, Italy. They are on E5, but the whole path will diverge slightly from the official E5 route because everything is already booked. As wild camping is prohibited in Austria, we will sleep in guest houses, mountain huts, and hotels. You need to book it in advance because when we did it two months before the hike, finding accommodation along the route was challenging. Here is the link to the route on komoot: [From Oberstdorf to Merano](https://www.komoot.com/tour/823062954)

![it is nice to hike knowing that you do not need to carry food for a week](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1661112304/e5_hike_preparations/gear.jpg)

I am glad that we don’t need to carry our tent, sleeping pad, cook kit, etc., because we bought that gear a long time ago without hiking in mind, so it is heavy and bulky. We still need our sleeping bags because that’s how you sleep in a mountain hut. Since we never actually did multi-day hikes, some gear we additionally bought for this adventure. That was backpacks, hiking boots, and a trowel (shit shovel).

![The trowel (shit shovel)](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1661280156/e5_hike_preparations/trowel.jpg)

Yep. A shit shovel. It is an essential piece of gear on a hike. Finally, we bought one, and from now on, we will dig catholes with style. That's actually funny how life is full of random stuff. If ten years ago someone would tell me that I would be the happy owner of a titanium shit shovel, I’d laugh my ass off.

![base weight](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1661112719/e5_hike_preparations/base_weight.jpg)

After testing and reading, we chose Osprey Exos 38 liter as our backpacks. I initially thought about a frameless ultralight backpack, but after trying them and Exos, we bought Exos. Yes, it is heavier than frameless options, but because the weight distribution is better, the same load feels much lighter. We packed them multiple times and dialed our base weight to about 8 kilos. Of course, I will weigh our backpacks before departure to know how much we will carry. Maybe, after all, I do not need that book with me :)

![Hiking boots](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1661280054/e5_hike_preparations/hiking_boots.jpg)

Boots. At first, I thought about going with my trail runners, but then we decided to be on the safe side and bought proper hiking boots. There is a ton of info on choosing the hiking boot, so I will not repeat it. I would add that the proper insole is a game changer.

![say hallo to the Alps](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1661202129/e5_hike_preparations/say_hallo_to_the_alps.jpg)

Wish us luck, and be ready for the lovely photos from the hike.

Here is a short version of the upcoming "About me" book :)

I have been lucky to have my first computer at age six. It was Atari 65XE, with BASIC programming language built-in.
Since then, computers is my passion, and I never really stop programming. My first web project came online in 2007, 
and it is still there. I got my first job as a developer in 2009.

My second passion is traveling. Only through traveling one can get a first-hand experience of foreign cultures and the 
beauties of nature. I like and do all sorts of traveling, planes, trains, cars, boats, bikes, on foot. This year, I 
tried kayaks (we have done something around 200 km in three days) and a motorcycle, which is now my favorite way of
getting to remote areas.

Overall I can describe myself as a friendly and communicable person.

Here is a problem that I am solving on almost every project: I need to have a generic way to manipulate data filtering options and pass them around. For example, I am building a CMS with a lot of data visualization (like tables and charts). Good data visualization should have a filtering ability. So users can filter the shit out of it and then send a link to the results.

I kind of tired of doing the same thing every time and want to do yarn add. And from today (yesterday, to be honest, but I did not have time to write this post), I can. And you can do it too.

```bash
npm i @barhamon/filters
```

Or, if you are a yarn user:

```bash
yarn add @barhamon/filters
```

 I tried to do my best with [read.me](https://github.com/Lurk/filters/blob/main/readme.md) in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Lurk/filters). So, for the sake of consistency, I will not repeat API here. But want to share my ideas of how I want to improve this package.

There is already a method to transform filters to MongoDB query so they can be used easily with Mongoose or just MongoDB driver. And I want to add integrations with other ORM/ODM like TypeORM. Also, since the backend can be written in different than JS languages, I want to write a port of this idea on your, my friend, favorite language (I will sooooooo write Rust crate for this. Soooooooooo write). And there should be examples of how to use it with different UI libraries. And better documentation. And investigate more space-efficient ways to communicate between the backend and frontend. And so on :)

I will gladly answer any questions or issues or accept pull requests.

Initially, I wanted to separate the "engine" from the data.

Today I did the first step in this direction. Pull request [#92](https://github.com/Lurk/barhamon/pull/92)

Now posts are stored not as React components but as a serializable tree.

This refactoring will allow not only to separate the "engine" from the data but also to separate the templates into a separate package. That means that sooner or later, there will be more than one theme :)

And the data itself can now be stored anywhere, which means that there will be connectors to MongoDB, Postgres, or JSON files.

It means that today is the birthday of the Bar part of barhamon.com :)

Good news, everyone.

Mari finally got a visa, so we are packing our stuff in Kyiv. And I got my residence permit. So soon, we will be deep into the integration process. Learning the language, revising driver's license, searching for a new flat, getting bicycles, etc.

And since I will be in Kyiv soon, I will visit my barber. This gorgeous beard and mustache that grew while I waited for Mari will be gone. Not completely, of course.

![gorgeous beard and mustache](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/c_scale,h_800,q_auto/v1631382491/header/good_news_everyone.jpg)

If you wondered what is going on with that memory leak, I am trying to fix. I did a [repo](https://github.com/Lurk/nsstring_leak) with tests and benchmarks, filed an [issue](https://github.com/SSheldon/rust-objc-foundation/issues/15) in objc-foundation repo. Now just waiting for the maintainer.

And in the meantime I did a lot of hikes. Munich offers a lot of you are like hiking. I am thinking to start doing hike reports, but I will not promise it yet. Here are some nice pictures I took during my hikes.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&first_hikes}}



What I definitely will do is a book's reviews. Lately, I am back to the book reading business. And will try my best to give you a summary of what I read.

But before that, I need to fix my old and trustworthy MBP, the screen of which went dead after eight years of service. Luckily for me, my friend has a spare one with some dead pixels. So maybe by the end of the week, I will have my laptop back.

More than half a year has passed since I moved to Munich.

Six months have passed since I moved to Germany. Locals say that Bavaria is different from all other Germany, but I don't fill it yet. Maybe that's because I was outside Bavaria only in Dresden. Dresden is undoubtedly different, but I don't know two exact cities, so this does not count. Anyway, when you read Germany - I mean Munich, Bavaria.

![Bavaria is quite a lovely place to live.](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1634986223/half_a_year/bavaria.jpg)

I still like it very much, especially now when our family is finally together. Despite our initial information that our reunion would take three months, it took roughly six. If you want to use our experience, keep in mind that I do not have a formal degree and can not apply for a blue card. With a blue card, things are different. 

Here is our timeline:

- 27 January - I got a contract
- 26 February - I got a visa
- 5 April - I moved to Munich
- 27 April - I got a registration
- 7 July - I applied for my residence permit
- 27 August - Mari applied for a visa
- 2 September - Mari got a visa, and I got my residence permit on the same day

![Real mountains](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1634986686/half_a_year/flat.jpg)

As I said, I still like how things are going here, and it looks like Mari is also like it here. A big part of it plays our flat, which is tiny but cozy, and the location is perfect, and the view from the balcony is fantastic. The bar is so high we have trouble finding something better in our budget. Munich itself is comfortable and ideally located. You know, one hour and you are in the proper mountains. Or, fly around Europe for 20 euros, which is mind-blowing for me. Or, if you are lazy today, put a hammock in one of the parks and chill the shit out of it.

![Real mountains](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1634986546/half_a_year/alps.jpg)

Also, six months have passed since I joined Check24 as a software engineer. My probation period ended on 1 October, and I got a promotion at the end of it. So, now I am a senior software engineer. The last time I had the senior prefix in the job title was in 2013. But you know, the list of things I do daily did not really change with the title. I still do a lot of code reviews, technical discussions, interviews, and of course, do the code. But now it is in my job description.

!!
! smile
I reread that last paragraph, and it looks like I am not excited. But I am. It is always nice to know that not only your mum thinks you are good at what you are doing.

With the end of quarantine restrictions, the number of people I interact with has increased, but everybody is still relaxed. And I like that a lot. So yeah, after my previous endeavors, this one feels chill, despite all the hustle with moving to another country. And I am still looking forward to not changing my mind.

Most changes are in the [Hamon theme](https://github.com/Lurk/Hamon), which is a good sign.

Each post ends with links to three similar posts. Similarity is currently measured by tag intersection. It works
surprisingly well but requires thinking about how to tag articles.

Long-time requested feature - images in postcards are clickable 🎉.

Another long-time requested feature is sticky navigation. Each page now has it. The title comes from the
[BAR configuration](https://github.com/Lurk/bar?tab=readme-ov-file#bar-project-configuration). The post page shows the
first tag. Both are links, but they do not look like them. I don’t know if that is okay. My gut feeling says that, at
this point, this type of navigation is so widespread that it is clear. I will wait for feedback.

There are also various other little improvements here and there, like consistent rounding and indentation, fixed footer
positioning, improved HTML structure, etc.

One more thing. Unfortunately, there is JavaScript. Since there is no way to enter fullscreen mode without JS, the
Hamon theme now contains four lines of
[JS code](https://github.com/Lurk/Hamon/blob/c75cc80f7a61c00069850ec80e9a375181b78fee/static/js.js#L1). Here is a
gallery with a few months of foto roll. Look at the `⛶` sign in the bottom-right corner.

I am still not in love with templating language, but in general I really like the result.

I will start with an anecdote.

At my work, I am responsible for building a service. It's not important what exactly it does. What is important is that to fulfill the business requirements, it should crunch the ever-growing array of data. And by crunch, I mean iterate over this array multiple times on every run.

Here is a very simplified version of that business requirement: convert Entity to SuperEntity, where SuperEntity is an Entity that has value > 2, has more than 1% of all entities in the group, and has the groupLength property.

Here are the types of both Entity and SuperEntity:

```typescript
export interface Entity {
  groupId: number;
  value: number;
}

export interface SuperEntity {
  groupId: number;
  value: number;
  groupLength: number;
}
```

Again this is a very simplified version. In the real world, we also need MegaEntity and TurboDieselEntity.

So, our input is an array of Entities. Here is how we generate it:

```typescript
export function getEntities(size: number): Entity[] {
  const result: Entity[] = new Array(size);
  for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
    result[i] = {
      groupId: getRandomInt(0, Math.ceil(size / 100)),
      value: getRandomInt(0, 100),
    };
  }
  return result;
}
```

And because we will need to access group length, let’s build a lookup map beforehand.

```typescript
export function createLookupMap(entities: Entity[]): Map<number, Entity[]> {
  let result: Map<number, Entity[]> = new Map();
  for (let i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
    const entity = entities[i];
    const val = result.get(entity.groupId);
    if (val) {
      val.push(entity);
    } else {
      result.set(entity.groupId, [entity]);
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

Now we are ready to write our Entity to SuperEntity transformer. The naive approach would look like this:

```typescript
export function convertToSuperEntities(
  lookup: Map<number, Entity[]>,
  entities: Entity[]
): SuperEntity[] {
  const groupSizeFilter = isEntityGroupBig.bind(null, lookup, entities.length);
  return entities
    .filter(isValueGreaterThatTwo)
    .filter(groupSizeFilter)
    .map((entity) => mapToSuperEntity(lookup, entity))
    .filter(isSuperEntity);
}
```

It looks nice and tidy. But remember the part of the task where input will constantly grow? That means, at some point, input will become so big that we will notice performance penalties from creating intermediate arrays on each step and iterating over them. Let's rewrite it with for loop.

```typescript
export function convertToSuperEntitiesWithLoop(
  lookup: Map<number, Entity[]>,
  entities: Entity[]
): SuperEntity[] {
  const result: SuperEntity[] = new Array(entities.length);
  const groupSizeFilter = isEntityGroupBig.bind(null, lookup, entities.length);
  let j = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < entities.length; i++) {
    const entity = entities[i];
    if (isValueGreaterThatTwo(entity) && groupSizeFilter(entity)) {
      const superEntity = mapToSuperEntity(lookup, entity);
      if (isSuperEntity(superEntity)) {
        result[j] = superEntity;
        j++;
      }
    }
  }
  return result.slice(0, j);
}
```

Performance wise it should be much better. No intermediate arrays, no array resizes, and no extra iterations. What I do not like is the decreased readability. Our nice flat eleven-line function became longer and curvier. Let's fix the readability issue with generators.

Generators are a special function that, instead of computing everything in one go and returning a result, returns an iterator that will compute the next chunk when you request it. This means that we can write the map and filter using generators.

The map is straightforward.

```typescript
export function* map<Input, Output>(
  functor: (args: Input) => Output,
  entries: Iterable<Input>
): Iterable<Output> {
  for (const entry of entries) {
    yield functor(entry);
  }
}
```

The filter is a bit complex because of the type definition of the predicate. We want to use type guards and functions that return a boolean as a predicate.

```typescript
type TypeguardPredicate<InputType, OutputType extends InputType> = (
  value: InputType
) => value is OutputType;
type BooleanPredicate<InputType> = (value: InputType) => boolean;
type Predicate<InputType, OutputType extends InputType> =
  | TypeguardPredicate<InputType, OutputType>
  | BooleanPredicate<InputType>;

export function* filter<InputType, OutputType extends InputType>(
  predicate: Predicate<InputType, OutputType>,
  entries: Iterable<InputType>
): Iterable<OutputType> {
  for (const entry of entries) {
    if (predicate(entry)) {
      yield entry;
    }
  }
}
```

Okay. Now we got everything we need. Let's write our transformer once more with helpers from above.

```typescript
export function convertToSuperEntitiesWithGenerators(
  lookup: Map<number, Entity[]>,
  entities: Entity[]
): SuperEntity[] {
  const groupSizeFilter = isEntityGroupBig.bind(null, lookup, entities.length);
  const greaterThanTwoIterable = filter(isValueGreaterThatTwo, entities);
  const andHasABigGroupIterable = filter(groupSizeFilter, greaterThanTwoIterable);
  const mappedIterable = map(
    (entity) => mapToSuperEntity(lookup, entity),
    andHasABigGroupIterable
  );
  return [...filter(isSuperEntity, mappedIterable)];
}
```

We are flat again. We do some extra work in the end because we need to convert our iterable to the array. Performance-wise this version should be slower than for loop version because generators should have some cost, but faster than the first attempt because we iterate only once and do not create any intermediate arrays.

At this point, I was so proud of myself. I thought, why nobody speaks about generators? And I should publish those small helper functions as a library. But then my teammate asked if I was sure the generator approach was that fast. I was sure, but *spoiler alert* I was wrong. Don’t be like me. Always write benchmarks when performing performance optimizations.

Benchmarking is hard to do, so if your aim is not a new benchmarking framework, use an existing one. I chose [benny](https://www.npmjs.com/package/benny). Why? It was first in Google results. So no actual research there, but it does everything I need and even can create an HTML page with nice visualization. Here is  the benchmark code:

```typescript
async function run(n: number) {
  const entities = getEntities(n);
  const lookup = createLookupMap(entities);
  return suite(
    `Entity(${n}) to SuperEntity transformer`,
    add("array methods", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntities(lookup, entities);
    }),
    add("for loop", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntitiesWithLoop(lookup, entities);
    }),
    add("generators", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntitiesWithGenerators(lookup, entities);
    }),
    cycle()
  );
}
```

And here is the result:

```bash
# npx ts-node src/benchmark.ts
Running "Entity(100000) to SuperEntity transformer" suite...
Progress: 100%

  array methods:
    4.5 ops/s, ±20.12%   | 6.25% slower

  for loop:
    4.8 ops/s, ±20.66%   | fastest

  generators:
    3.9 ops/s, ±18.90%   | slowest, 18.75% slower

```

I expected a more significant difference between array methods and for-loop. But let's get back to our elephant in the room. Why are generators so slow?

I went to the V8 source code to find the answer to this question. But it is surprisingly hard to read and navigate. So I went on a googling quest. Nobody seems to be concerned about whole generators being slow situation. All the info I found was from 2013-2015, and the conclusion is that generators are slow. That was no news to me. I am interested In finding out why. Last resort, the spec. I fell asleep multiple times while reading it, but it looks like I know the answer.

TLDR: It is slow because the generator function will manipulate the call stack on every iteration. 

The spec says that the generator should create an alternative call stack, and on every iteration, it will insert this call stack into the program call stack and execute it until the yield statement. Yield will update the call stack of this generator and remove it from the program call stack. This is what makes generators slow.

If that explanation does not help, imagine my handwaving. You are welcome. And if you want to check everything by yourself, here is the link to the [ECMA-262 27.5.3](https://262.ecma-international.org/13.0/#sec-generator-abstract-operations) in full glory.

But! But we can create iterators by ourselves, right? Generators are excellent when you want to make any arbitrary function return an iterator, and we need only two functions.

Here is the map function:

```typescript
export function map<InputType, OutputType>(
  functor: (arg: InputType) => OutputType,
  iterable: Iterable<InputType>
): Iterable<OutputType> {
  return {
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
      const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
      return {
        next() {
          const { value, done } = iterator.next();
          if (done) {
            return { value: undefined, done: true };
          } else {
            return { value: functor(value), done: false };
          }
        },
      };
    },
  };
}
```

Here is the filter:

```typescript
type TypeguardPredicate<InputType, OutputType extends InputType> = (
  value: InputType
) => value is OutputType;
type BooleanPredicate<InputType> = (value: InputType) => boolean;
type Predicate<InputType, OutputType extends InputType> =
  | TypeguardPredicate<InputType, OutputType>
  | BooleanPredicate<InputType>;

export function filter<InputType, OutputType extends InputType>(
  predicate: Predicate<InputType, OutputType>,
  iterable: Iterable<InputType>
): Iterable<OutputType> {
  return {
    [Symbol.iterator]() {
      const iterator = iterable[Symbol.iterator]();
      return {
        next() {
          let { value, done } = iterator.next();
          while (done === false && !predicate(value)) {
            const result = iterator.next();
            value = result.value;
            done = result.done;
          }
          if (done) {
            return { value: undefined, done: true };
          } else {
            return { value, done };
          }
        },
      };
    },
  };
}
```

Yeah, I remember that we are solving the readability problem of the for-loop version. And with helpers like that, it makes the readability problem even worse. But since we are already here, let's benchmark it anyway.

Guess how our transformer function looks?

```typescript
export function convertToSuperEntitiesWithIterators(
  lookup: Map<number, Entity[]>,
  entities: Entity[]
): SuperEntity[] {
  const groupSizeFilter = isEntityGroupBig.bind(null, lookup, entities.length);
  const greaterThanTwoIterable = filter(isValueGreaterThatTwo, entities);
  const andHasABigGroupIterable = filter(groupSizeFilter, greaterThanTwoIterable);
  const mappedIterable = map(
    (entity) => mapToSuperEntity(lookup, entity),
    andHasABigGroupIterable
  );
  return [...filter(isSuperEntity, mappedIterable)];
}
```

Here is the updated benchmark:

```typescript
async function run(n: number) {
  const entities = getEntities(n);
  const lookup = createLookupMap(entities);
  return suite(
    `Entity(${n}) to SuperEntity transformer`,
    add("array methods", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntities(lookup, entities);
    }),
    add("for loop", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntitiesWithLoop(lookup, entities);
    }),
    add("generators", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntitiesWithGenerators(lookup, entities);
    }),
    add("iterators", () => {
      return convertToSuperEntitiesWithIterators(lookup, entities);
    }),
    cycle()
  );
}
```

And here is the result:

```bash
# npx ts-node src/benchmark.ts
Running "Entity(100000) to SuperEntity transformer" suite...
Progress: 100%

  array methods:
    4.8 ops/s, ±17.19%   | 2.04% slower

  for loop:
    4.9 ops/s, ±21.21%   | fastest

  generators:
    4 ops/s, ±19.09%     | slowest, 18.37% slower

  iterators:
    4.4 ops/s, ±12.05%   | 10.2% slower
```

Here we are. I will use this post as proof that any performance optimization made upfront is useless. I mean, there is no sense in using generators for performance optimization. And I think we can agree that there is no sense in using iterators to solve the readability and performance problems. So we left with array methods and for-loop, where the difference is around 5%.

When you are in the measuring contest, it’s hard to stop. And I have a few questions to ask. For example, how different are the results for different input sizes? 

![operations per second array methods vs for loop vs generators vs iterators](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1670884694/iterations_in_js/ops_rvye5j.png)

There is nothing visible on a linear scale, so this is a logarithmical one. And even though I was expecting for-loop to be a winner with a big margin, in reality, things are different.

![difference in performance array methods vs for loop vs generators vs iterators](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1670884709/iterations_in_js/diff_p4cxq8.png)

Do you see? Something strange happens around 20_000 and 65_000 input sizes. I rerun the whole thing multiple times on different machines, and it is still there. If you know what it is and why it is there, drop me a message, I would also like to know.

!!
! info circle
I also wanted to add a nodejs vs deno vs bun comparison. But deno does not have JSON output from the benchmarking tool [yet](https://github.com/denoland/deno/issues/14385), and I am too lazy to parse console output.
!!

But let's get back to generators. Why may you still want to use them? You may want to use generators when you get data in chunks, and those chunks are arriving slower than you can process them. Imagine any IO operation, reading from the filesystem, network, etc. Instead of waiting till all the chunks are received, you can start processing the data while waiting for the next chunk. You can do that with streams or generators. I find stream API hard to make type-safe and compose. This leaves only one real option - generators. If you want an example, check out [readline API](https://nodejs.org/api/readline.html#rlsymbolasynciterator), and imagine how easily you can apply map and filter helpers from the above.

Let's stop here. I hope that you had fun reading this. I had fun writing it. And I feel it lacks some bullet points in the end, so here we go.

**Mandatory bullet points at the end:**

+ Newer do a performance optimization without benchmarks.
+ Generators in javascript are slow.
+ Array methods in Javascript are surprisingly fast.

I ran all those benchmarks on the cheapest Hetzner server (CX11), which has one vCPU and 2GB of RAM. With Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS and NodeJS 18.12.1 on top.

tags:

---

A couple of times in a year, I got asked something like: "what language/technology I should learn" or "I have this idea, with what I should build it".

Here is what and why:

### Language:

If you are asking, the chances are high that you are don't know what you are doing. So go with JS. JS (TS is slightly better, but the learning curve is steeper) will allow you to do quick and dirty prototypes for everything. And I mean, it. You can do frontend, backend, mobile, desktop, ML all in one language (I even saw microcontrollers with JS support. How crazy is that?). This means you don't need to switch context too often, which means you are more productive. Big community is a bonus.

Sure, JavaScript is not perfect, and there are better alternatives for:

- Sciency or ML - Python. 
- Blazing fast or/and close to the hardware - Rust
- iOS - Swift
- Android - Kotlin
- Microcontrollers - C
- Scalable AF - Erlang

And still, you will need JS to do the frontend. So learn one language. Do everything, and when you know which part of your product should be rewritten with more suited language - you will do it. 

### Database:

My go-to choice is MongoDB. It is pretty simple, and you can do whatever you want with the schema while you are prototyping. Also, you will scale It effortlessly when your prototype became a production.

I also often use Redis when performance is the primary concern. And nowadays it has all bells and whistles you can think of, including queues and time series.

And sometimes, when persistence is not required, no DB is also an option.

### REST vs. GraphQL:

I will choose GraphQL over REST because I never saw REST API, which was working as intended. And because of that, documentation is often missing or outdated. Swagger kind of slowed this issue, but for me, it is a half-assed solution. Because your OpenAPI specification does not depend on actual code, you need to describe APIs twice. While using libraries like type-graphql - documentation and playground reflect your current code. So you write your code and get documentation and playground for your API for free.

If you came here with questions like questions in the first paragraph, I hope this post will somehow help you.

I was fascinated with operating systems for a long time. And the thought of learning more about them always sits at the back of my mind. But I can identify at least a couple of reasons why I never did something in that domain. While I can read C-like languages, and with some effort, understand the code, every time I looked at Linux kernel source code, I saw unicorns and fairies. I would say that the kernel is not beginner-friendly, which is not a bad thing. But I felt like I needed to invest a lot of time before contributing. And some things were more fun and sometimes profitable than properly learning C and understanding kernel. So I never did.

Despite all of that, I occasionally read articles or news on that topic. And when I saw [“Just for fun”™ Linux on Rust rewrite](https://seiya.me/writing-linux-clone-in-rust), I immediately jumped in. Maybe “jumped in” sounds over-enthusiastic because I know nothing about the kernel development and still don't feel comfortable with Rust. But anyway, I can read and navigate the source code, identify spots that I can fix, and fix them. Which is a vast improvement over the original kernel for me :)

If you can relate to what I wrote above, check out [Kerla](https://github.com/nuta/kerla). It is in the early stages of development, so people with all levels of knowledge can find what to do. There are a lot of decisions to make, a lot of code to write. 

And yes, it is fun

Or I cycled 800 kilometers from the Barents Sea to the Baltic Sea.

That was my first time in Lapland, and in general, I have never been so far north. It was also my first long bike tour
and my first solo adventure that long. I liked it very much. My answer is yes if you ask me if I will do it again.

If you got to this article with the question of whether you should visit Lapland, the answer is also yes. It does not
matter if you do that on a car, or foot, or a bicycle, or a kayak, or a motorcycle, whatever. Go. You will not find
that kind of nature that accessible anywhere. I had a 5G network connection the whole time except one day. That day, I
was still able to call Marie. It is EU, which means no roaming problems if you have an EU SIM card. You can pay with
your card, Apple Pay, or Google Pay anywhere. The roads are good, and the trails are maintained enough. The people, if
you find them, are incredibly nice. Go.

If you’re interested in how I got that idea and how I prepared, here is the
[EDT Finland preparations](/post/EDT_Finland_preparations.html) article. I thought I would mostly ride in Finland, but
it turned out that I spent two days in Norway, six days in Finland, and seven days in Sweden.

Since that article, I have bought plane tickets there and back. The plan was that I will have 11 full cycling days,
plus half of the first day. Komoot showed that the route is 736 km in length. That means I will have to ride at least
65 km per day. I did a few test runs on a fully loaded bicycle, up 100 km in a day. It was hard, but riding 65 km per
day seemed doable.

Gear-wise, I was fine except for rain gear and a half-broken multitool. The bike worked flawlessly. Camping gear did
keep me dry and warm. Most nights on my trip, I used a sleeping bag as a blanket because it was too warm. Didn’t have
any punctures in the sleeping pad. The chair was used multiple times daily, and I have no regrets about carrying it. My
cook kit worked as always. The water filter got clogged more and more during the trip. On the first day, I could fill
my bottles in 15 minutes. Closer to the journey’s end, it was around 50, but I had time, so no complaints. I had
camping clothes in a separate dry bag and was glad to wear them every evening. I had set of clean clothes (socks,
underwear, long sleeve) in another dry bag for the flight back. I was drying wet clothes on my front bag and washing
dirty ones when needed.

In the last days before the trip, I started to be paranoid about phone charging and ordered a solar charger. I had low
expectations, but it worked very well. My phone was constantly in flight mode, with Komoot recording the track.
Occasionally, I would turn off flight mode to call Marie and send pictures. In that mode, the phone battery held up to
two days. I could always charge a full power bank with the solar panel in two days.

On the first day, my multitool lost a few tools. Luckily, I did not need them. The ratchet one worked flawlessly,
though.

Before the trip, I tested my poncho in the rain. It looked like it would work, but it didn’t. I was soaking wet during
the first hours of my trip. And it does make you pedal twice as hard, especially with a headwind. I stopped using it as
rain gear on the first day and used it only as a footprint for my tent. Next time, I would like to have proper
waterproof pants. My Patagonia hardshell kept my torso perfectly dry on the wettest day. I can recommend that one.

## Budget

```Markdown
Plane tickets (me and bicycle) 	€751.04
Bike service and parts 		€163.10
Groceries + eating out 		€433.58
Hotels and camping's 		€313.70
Transport 			€69.35

Expenses before the trip (1-2) 	€914.14
Expenses during the trip (3-5) 	€816.63
Total 				€1,730.77
```

If my card had not been blocked and my flight had not been canceled on the last day, it would have been around 300
euros less.

## Stats

In eleven riding days, with one full rest day in between, I cycled 782.25 km (71.11 on average) and gained 4.660 m of 
elevation. There were a few bits that I have not recorded, so from now on, I will say that I cycled 800 kilometers above
the Arctic Circle and slept with the bears.

### Day 0

My friend Evgeny volunteered to drive me to the airport at 5 a.m. Thank you, man. After a short ride, I got to the
airport. To get a trolley, you need two euros, which is hard to get at 6 a.m. But the car entrance to the airport costs
three euros, which means you will get at least 2 euros back no matter how big of a banknote you feed to the soulless
machine collecting fee.

When I finally found check-in, I saw that there were already all sorts of outdoor people in the queue. Near me, a group
offishermen were loading a massive thermobox to check it in.

- What is in the box? - asked the airport worker.
- Wine and beer. - declared the group head after some negotiation between group members.
- Respect. - airport worker
- 😁 - everybody.

Power banks are allowed only in hand luggage, so I searched for duct tape. If you ever need duct tape in Munich
airport, it is in the farthest right corner of a Müller shop.

The flight was uneventful, and the apple tags I put into my boxes showed they had arrived. The box with gear arrived
without any visible damage, but the bicycle box had a few new holes. I patched those holes with duct tape I bought in
Munich. I hoped to leave the bicycle in a locker, but all the lockers of appropriate size were already occupied. Now,
I am stuck in the airport till morning. If you ever need to spend the night in Oslo airport you will find wooden
benches that are flat and long enough to take a semi-comfortable nap near Burger King.

### Day 1

I woke up at 4 a.m. because my sleep was not very good. The airport was filled with sleeping people in random places.
Pro tip: Pack your sleeping pad and bag to access it easily. You will find plenty of spots for your bivouac on the
second floor.

Check-in and bicycle drop-off were smooth.

Kirkines airport is relaxed. We walked from the plane through the field, and the door that leads outside is in the 
baggage room. After all those big and busy airports, that is a new experience for me. At the airport, I met a guy who 
had just finished the Iceland loop and wanted to do EDT.

The bike assembly went smoothly. The only surprise was from my Leatherman. Half of the tools just fell out of it.
Gladly, that was not the important half.

It was drizzling all the way, but I decided not to wait until it stopped, so I cycled to the city, where I went
shopping. At the Intersport, I met another guy who retired a month ago and plans to ride EDT until September. I am
jealous.

When I finished shopping, the drizzle became proper rain. I put up my poncho and cycled to the border with Finland.
Poncho was a mistake. I tested it as my rain gear in warm conditions. Even if I got wet, I dried out quickly. It turns
out that if it is cold, you are not drying out. At all. At some point, I stopped and took a poncho and wet puffy jacket
off. I put on my rain jacket and continued cycling. I was wet but happy because everything around me was extremely
beautiful. A few times, a small hoard of reindeer was running alongside.

I found a shelter with a roof and decided it was enough cycling for today. I hung my wet clothes, pitched my tent, and
cooked my food under the roof.

### Day 2

I woke up early, cooked breakfast, packed my stuff, and tidied up the place. Around 9 am, a lady arrived in a van. She
was camping along the river and came here for breakfast because the mosquito situation there was unbearable. The
shelter is a bit uphill, and mosquitos are almost nonexistent.

When I was ready to start, the drizzle started again. But I went on anyway, and that was the right decision. The
drizzle was starting and stopping the whole day.

Right after the Finnish border, I found the shop with everything, including fishing baits, Dr Pepper, cucumber, canned
deer meat, and various chocolate bars. I asked if I should have a license to fish, and locals said that I only need a
permit if I fish in the waterfalls and areas marked as no-fishing zones.

I rode until noon, found a nice place to cook lunch by the lake, and was overwhelmed by the number of mosquitoes that
wanted to eat me alive. I thanked Marie, who insisted on buying a bug net while putting it on.

At around 65 km, I started looking for a turn from the road, discarded a few, and found a nice one that led to a lake.
That evening, I was camping on a beach. It was too cold for a swim, but I tried to fish—unsuccessfully. I got to bed
early to try again in the morning.

### Day 3

I got up early. I attempted to get a fish for breakfast but was again unsuccessful. I had muesli and tea for breakfast.
Then, I packed the camp and hit the road around ten.

Around noon, I found a small boat station marked as shelter on a map for lunch. I had lunch with a view of the biggest
lake in Finland and started to ride again around three.

The route for this day included a big off-pavement section, and I had high hopes of finding a nice spot to camp. I saw
tens of lakes along the route, and that grilled fish was constantly on my mind. I planned to start looking for that
camping spot on a lake after I cycled 65 km. The off-pavement section started as an excellent gravel road. I remember
telling myself that the third day is usually the most challenging day on an adventure, physically and mentally. But
this time, everything was so smooth and easygoing. I thought that’s because my planning skills have improved over the
years. At some point, an excellent gravel road turned into a single track through the swamp. Sometimes, it was barely
rideable, and sometimes, it was not. That was at the 60 km, so I thought I would tough it out 5 km and then camp, fish,
dinner, etc. The map confirmed that idea. The swampy part should end soonish, and then the lake. I also saw a bicycle
trail in the mud here and there, which I took as a good sign.

At some point, a bicycle trail disappeared. The swamp did end, and I saw many lakes left and right but with no way of
getting to them. While exploring one of the turns to the lake, I met a couple, and they showed me the direction where
I should find a place to camp by the other lake. That was along my path anyway, so I cycled a bit more. At around nine
PM, I still have not found a spot. I checked the map, and it showed me a shelter by the lake. I heard rumors that in
Finland, you could find a sauna in the woods, and that image of me jumping to the lake right after the sauna and
grilling a huge freshly caught fish flashed in my mind. When I found a turn to that cabin, it looked like the turn
nobody with a loaded bike should take. But I said to myself, “C’mon, that’s why you came here,” and took the turn. It
was a single track that had disappeared into the swamp. Those swamps are the worst. You carry your bike knee-deep in
the mud covered with mosquitos—hour after hour. Sometimes, you get to a dry hill, where stopping without drowning in
the mud is possible, but mosquitos kill all the joy.

At around eleven, my path was blocked by the fence. The moment I saw it, I almost burst into tears. The thought of
going back the same way scared the shit out of me. Then I realized that “gates” were in front of me. They just looked
like solid fences. I unknot the part of the fence, dragged the bike in, and then knotted it back. I arrived at my
destination, which turned out to be some archeological site and the church—no jumping to the lake after the sauna.

Despite the time, I found people. They said that overnight stays are prohibited, but they saw that I was in a dire
situation, and if I got out before 9 a.m., I could stay. That was my record time to set up a tent, cook/eat dinner,
bathe in the lake, and sleep.

### Day 4

I woke up in panic mode because it was bright. I thought that tourists would start swarming around me any second. When
I checked the time, I packed my tent and was ready to go. It was 6 a.m.

Luckily, the trail to Inari had no swamps, but it was rocky and unrideable. I spent three hours hiking my bike out of
it. When I reached Inari, I was already so tired that I decided to get a hotel and sleep in bed. Nine in the morning,
it was too early to check into the hotel, so I found one around 30 km along my route. I asked Marie to book it for me
and cycled there. It was the hardest 30 km in my life. It was mostly uphill, and the constant headwind did not make it
easier for me.

In the hotel, I went to bed. After two hours, I got sausages and grilled them for lunch. The sausages were meh despite
my hunger and having a very nice grill. Three years in Bavaria made me picky about sausages. After that, sleep again.
In three hours, I had an exceptional dinner and went to sleep.

Shower. Sleep. Eat. Repeat.

### Day 5

The breakfast was as exceptional as the dinner. I packed my stuff and was in the saddle around 11 a.m.

The headwind was still making my ride miserable, especially today. Today, I should have reached the highest point on my
route, so the first part of my day was primarily uphill. On that hill, I met a guy from France who had been cycling
since January. He asked if I had found any of the famous free saunas he had heard so much about but had yet to see any.
I strongly advised him to avoid making my mistake and ask locals for directions. He was surprised by how little stuff I
have on a bike, but we agreed that you don’t need more for a two-week ride.

After a mandatory snack in Pokka, I found a flat enough spot in the woods to pitch a tent and went to sleep.

-----

### Day 6

I finally figured out what should go where on my bike. Now packing the camp takes around half an hour.

Twenty kilometers down the gravel highway, I found a nice spot on a river to snack and fill my water bottles. While
waiting for the filter to do its job, two Finns arrived to fly fish. They also said it is the wettest summer in their
lifetime, and everything is full of water. Usual fishing spots do not work anymore or have become swamps, and they are
searching for new ones.

On my trail was a checkpoint named “Cheap and Tasty Restaurant“. I arrived there at 3:50 p.m., and the sign said they
were working until 4 p.m. Stuff was kind enough to feed me delicious soup and cakes even though they were closing.

I had two options for camp: one on a bird-watching tower and the other in a charming hut above the lake with a fire pit
and panoramic windows on a mountain. I checked out the bird-watching tower, and it was nice. Along it was a shelter
with a roof and barbecue with all the tools, but it was right in front of a swamp, and as soon as I stopped, I was
covered with mosquitoes. I decided to check out that second option.

Marie and I are fans of AoT, and when I reached the city sign Levi, I asked a passing cyclist to take a photo of me with
it. I went to the grocery store in the city to refill my food supplies. I ran out of noodles, canned meat, chocolate
bars, vegetables, etc. I also grabbed a pack of sausages, “Levi from Reindeer.” Who would not?

When I reached the cabin, it was crowded. I was not in the mood for conversation, so I went further. My next spot on
the route was a twenty-kilometer-away spot called the Secluded Shelter. It started to rain at some point, but at least
the headwind died out.

The secluded shelter was superb years ago, but now the windows were broken and full of litter. I noticed one more
shelter on the other side of the lake, with a half-rotten wooden path leading to it. Since I was already wet, I decided
to try my luck and reach it.

I did reach it with my feet wetter than before. The shelter barely fit my tent, and the floor was a bit tilted, but
otherwise, it was perfect. The wood around me was too wet to make a fire, so I had a quick snack, pitched a tent under
the roof without rain cover, and enjoyed the view with a show in the sky. The clouds were moving so fast that I had the
sun and the rain switching every few minutes.

### Day 7

I woke up with a plan to spend a day here. You know, get some fish from the lake, grill it, swim, and relax. But it was
raining, and the fish ignored my baits. So, around lunch, I decided to move and find another place.

At some point, the rain stopped, and the sun started to shine. Right before the lake, where I planned to have lunch,
I met a cyclist cycling from Spain to the Nordkap. We exchanged spots for camp, and right before we said goodbye, he
asked if I had everything I needed. Man, I didn’t ask for your name, but if you are reading this, know you are awesome.

I found a shelter with a roof right on time because the rain started again when I got under the roof. The rain allowed
me to cook lunch, make tea and sandwiches, and rest properly. As soon as it stopped, I continued cycling to the border
with Sweden.

I wanted to stay at a camping site to have a proper shower and a fire pit to grill those Levi sausages. Somehow, I
missed the one on the Finnish side and cycled to a campsite in Pajala, where I found everything I needed, plus a sauna.
And the sausages were delicious this time. If you ever are in Levi, get those and grill them.

### Day 8

I had a chat at breakfast with a Norwegian family of three. They were traveling north and fishing along the way. At
some point, the dude showed off his rods and lures and gave me a wire leader because I did not have one.

The sun burned so hard that I unpacked a solar charger and plugged my phone into it. 20% of the charge was left. I
properly cleaned the dishes, packed my gear, had one more final shower, and was ready to take off. I checked how my
phone was doing, and it was charged to a nice 69%. I strapped the solar panel to my bike and plugged one of the power
banks into it.

That Norwegian family drank Coca-Cola the whole time, and I badly wanted some poison like that. I got a can of
Coca-Cola in the nearest supermarket and, on a first sip, realized it was sugar-free. I was so disappointed that I got
a can of Fanta to save the day.

I found a lovely beach on the lake for lunch in the middle of the day. It had benches, tables, and grill shelter. When
my noodles were almost ready, it started to rain, so I moved to that grill shelter and had a dry lunch. While waiting
for the rain to stop, I considered staying here for the night. I saw fish in the lake, there were enough facilities to
make it comfortable in the rain. But when the rain stopped and the sun started to shine, I decided to find a nice spot
somewhere further.

When I was almost ready to go, a couple in a motorhome came. They were from Munich, and I had an opportunity to
practice my German.

Around thirty kilometers further, I met a group of cyclists from Germany who were cycling to a Nordkap. One of them
was a fisherman, like me, who had yet to be successful. I pointed to the location of a lake on a map. It was a bit far,
but that’s the best camping spot I have seen today. I hope those guys reached it and had a wonderful stay. The place I
hoped to stay for the night, marked as a shelter, turned out to be just a parking lot. After a rainy day, finding a
place to pitch a tent without a puddle is hard. A few hours later, I found a dry enough spot and fell asleep.

### Day 9

The night was without rain, so there was no need to dry the tent. For breakfast, I had a quick muesli. Then, I packed
everything and rode to the nearest water source.

Around lunch, I crossed the polar circle. From now on, I will get sunsets and sunrises. The point has a huge sign, so
it’s hard to miss.

I looked for a for lunch spot along the river, but all of them were so full of mosquitoes that I was forced to search
for a better place. A better place, with a proper bench, table, and view, was found near a movable bridge. I spent at
least an hour there, mainly because my water filter started to filter very slowly. From now on, filling my water
bottles began to take around 40 minutes.

In the evening, I reached the camping spot in Nybyn that was recommended to me a few days ago. Before even unpacking my
tent, I set up a fishing rod. I tried all the bates I had, and after an hour, I put a simple floater with bread on a
hook. While adjusting the depth, I did a few testing runs, and on a third one, a big enough fish attacked the floater
and then the bread with the hook. I finally got a fish for dinner. The camping spot had all you need to grill the fish,
and I had salt and pepper with me. I am the happiest man alive.

-----

### Day 10

I got out of the tent pretty late because of the rain. I hoped it would die out, and it almost stopped a few times,
but then I checked the sky and the forecast. Both said that the rain would not stop until tomorrow. After some
thinking, I decided that cycling in the rain is much more fun than camping in the rain. Plus, my next stop promised a
sauna.

Överkalix city was a bit on the side from my route, but I almost ran out of food and badly wanted some fruits, so I
went there. After refilling my food bag and mandatory snack, I returned to my route. E10 was my first busy road in ten
days. With no roadside and rain, every passing car is a challenge. Trucks are even worse. I stopped at the first bus
stop with a roof and looked for alternatives. On the other side of the river, there was an excellent empty gravel road
that l could use.

At some point, I was completely wet. Not completely. My Patagonia Torrentshell did a great job keeping my torso dry,
but everything else was soaking wet. It wasn’t cold, though, at least while I was cycling, and there were no nice spots
with a roof to make a long break. I was cycling, I was wet, and I was warm.

When I reached my spot, I was still wet. The place was full of other cyclists. French couple that is cycling to Nordkap
and back to France in half a year, a Finnish guy that is cycling from Helsinki to Stockholm light and fast, a Swiss
couple that is going to Nordkap, and a Brazilian guy that is cycling from Germany to the Nordkap and back. We shared
our stories, had dinner and sauna, and went to sleep happy. Jumping into the river, after the sauna, after a full day
of cycling in the rain does make you happy.

-----

### Day 11

Due to various reasons, I had around 70 km to cover in two days. I could cycle closer to my destination, but some of my
clothes were still wet, and I was not guaranteed to find a sauna somewhere along the way. I decided to stay, dry my
stuff, and chill.

Around ten a.m., all of my new cycling friends had left, and I was alone until lunch. Somewhere at lunchtime, a local
guy showed up. He is the one who maintains this place, and we had an enjoyable chat. I was curious about life in such a
place, and he was motivated to tell me everything: schools, people, prices, bears, mushrooms, rivers, projects,
potatoes, etc. At some point:

- What about the winter? - I asked.
- We have winter, yes.
- 😁

When he left, I unpacked my fishing rod and went fishing. Mosquitos were terrible. After a few hours and a dozen
not-big-enough fish, I gave up and cooked my last noodles.

Jumping to the river after the sauna is nice, even without cycling in the rain beforehand.

### Day 12

A French couple recommended camping in the Luleå. I plan to get there, sleep early, and wake up at four tomorrow to
pack my bicycle and reach the airport before noon.

Somewhere in the middle of the day, a few cyclists from Denmark overtook me. They were driving from Nordkap and said
that Nordkap was too crowded. I believe that claim because most cyclists and caravans I meet on the way are going to
Nordkap.

My card was declined when I stopped at a gas station for a snack. I was upset about that, but I had a few chocolate
bars and didn’t pay enough attention. When my card was declined on camping, l was confused. Even though I had cash, I
could not pay with cash anywhere because everything was cashless. When I finally figured out the money question, Marie
got home from a hike, and I connected her card to my phone. Marie also helped me find and book a hotel nearby. I
checked in, cooked my dinner, and fell asleep.

### Day 13

I woke up at six a.m. to be first at breakfast. While deciding between boiled eggs and scrambled eggs, I got an SMS
about my flight being canceled. The only way to get home is the next day at six a.m. I could not do anything, so I
made a new plan: sleep till noon, pack the bicycle and bring it to the airport, and then decide what to do.

I found a bicycle shop that promised to leave a bike box quickly. There were boxes of different sizes. And space big
enough for me to disassemble the bike. I was done in a record-breaking 45 minutes.

Next adventure: a taxi. There are no Uber cars in Luleå, and the local taxi app does not accept my phone number, so I
Googled a phone number for a taxi company. The first car was too small for my bike box, and the second guy was on a
wan. We talked a lot on the way. As always, I asked how he likes the winter. He said that vodka and barbecue help him
survive the winter.

At the airport, my huge box and I instantly grabbed the attention of the airport staff. They helped me figure out that
even though the box was okay size-wise, it was too heavy. The absolute limit is 32 kilos, and my box is 35. So I left
it at the airport and went to the bicycle shop, hoping to find a small box.

Toe on my right foot started to hurt. Last year, I dropped a motorcycle on it in
[the mountains of Turkey](/post/tet_turkey_ride.html). I had a black nail for a year, which came off right before this
year’s adventure. It was ok the whole time, but now it hurts.

It was already around four in the afternoon, and I was starving. On my way to the bike shop, I stopped at a cafe and
got my salmon burger with glass of beer. That was the best glass of Carlsberg in my life.

The smallest box was a box from a child’s bicycle. It did fit all my gear and some bicycle parts. In the end, I had one
box with a bike, 23 kg, and one more box with everything else, 12 kg. Airport staff checked me and my boxes in, so in
the morning, I will need only to drop those boxes off. The airport opens at five am, and the first bus starts from the
city at 4:30 am. I left my boxes in the airport’s dark corner and returned to the town.

Found a new hotel, closer to a bus stop. Grocery store on the way. Check-in in different building. My toe hurts AF.

I had a cookie, Yogurt, and cherry for dinner.

I hoped that tomorrow on Monday, I would have time to prepare myself for a German language exam scheduled for Tuesday.
The best course of action is sleep.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&lapland-2024-day-13}}

### Day 14

I woke up. I had yogurt and cake for breakfast. I did not miss my bus. In the airport, everything was smooth. In
Stockholm, AirTags showed me that my boxes had arrived. I quickly found my gate to Munich. Everything was suspiciously
smooth. When I landed in Munich, AirTags showed that the boxes were with me. I assembled the bike in a whopping 25
minutes. At around three p.m., I was home, and all my gear was sorted.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&lapland-2024-day-14}}

-----

## At home

The toe still requires medical attention. Last week, I visited a few doctors, resulting in an antibiotic course. The
next doctor’s appointment is tomorrow.

Returning to a “normal life” after those trips has always been difficult mentally for me. Everything seems irrelevant.
But I managed to pass a German language exam the next day after I returned. It shook me up, and somehow, normal life is
normal again.

I rewrote my blog without any JS.  

I have been doing JS full-time/stack for over ~~9000~~ fifteen years. I did a few IPTV apps for various platforms and 
a dozen websites in those years. I have solved every front-end problem with React for the last ten years. Since then, 
the web platform has evolved so much that a usual website does not need JS, and you are looking at the proof of that 
statement. 

!!
! pepper-hot
I also have some strong opinions on the direction that Vercel pushes the React ecosystem, which may end up in a 
separate post. Spoiler alert! That direction sucks. 
!!

In the process of rewriting this blog, I produced a few artifacts which may be interesting. 

## YAMD

[Yet another markdown document (flavor)](https://crates.io/crates/yamd) implemented in Rust markdown to Serde 
serializable tree of nodes parser.

I thought about parsing markdown as an easy task. I was so naive that on version 0.2.0, I wrote, `It is ready to poke 
around. There are no significant API changes expected.` in the readme file. That was fixed only at 0.10.0. 

I kept notes while implementing it [Yamd notes](/post/yamd-notes.html). I should do it (notes) more often.

The following steps are implementing a proper lexer, introducing escape sequences, tree-sitter, etc. 

## Cloudinary Rust client

That’s not a new [crate](https://crates.io/crates/cloudinary), but I added some stuff to it, and to my surprise, other 
people did a few pull requests. There is still a long way to a release, but we are getting there. 

Implementing it I got a few good insights on how image transformations API should look like. I will need to implement 
some of those in BAR.

!!
! handshake
Here is my Cloudinary 
[referal link](https://console.cloudinary.com/invites/lpov9zyyucivvxsnalc5/hqd3swadmblfw3ivxjmv?t=default). Every 
registration is expanding my free tier, so I can post more cat photos.

Thank you. 
!!

## BAR

Static website generator. Every web developer should write one, right? 

The idea is simple. Read some files, render that data as HTML, and save those HTML files to the specified folder. But 
then, you do not need just any files. They must be in a suitable format. That’s why Yamd. You also need machinery to 
handle static files, feeds, etc.

Then, you need to find a template engine. From the beginning, I wanted to be able to render different templates. That 
requirement alone significantly limited my options. All nice `rsx` stuff was out of the picture because there is no 
easy way to include arbitrary rust code after the compilation.  

I want a template engine that has the following:

- A way to expose custom API to the template. 
- Nice way to define components because I want to structure my template code so it does not suck right away.  
- It should be as close to the resulting HTML as possible. 
- Tooling: tree-sitter, type checking, linter, prettier, etc.

Ultimately, I chose [Tera](https://keats.github.io/tera/docs/) mainly because exposing BAR API to the template is 
relatively easy. Developing a theme with it reminded me of the old days of doing PHP and Smarty. I would consider 
moving to another template engine if I find something better. Also, version 2 of Tera is in progress, but I haven’t 
read anything yet.

Anyway, here is the first template for BAR - [Hamon](https://github.com/Lurk/Hamon). 

Another adventure is code highlighting. I chose [Syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect/) to do the job. In the 
middle of integration, it turned out that they do not support TypeScript. I spent some time getting around it, but 
now, if you already use or are planning to use Syntect and need Typescript support, here is the way to do it 
[Syntect SyntaxSet with Typescript support](https://github.com/Lurk/syntect_ts). 

I have many ideas on how to improve the whole BAR situation: docs, git integration, webhooks for automatic site 
rendering, partial rerendering, comments, etc. 

So yeah, come and build some websites with [BAR](https://github.com/Lurk/bar). 

## Serve

[Simple HTTP(S) server for static files](https://github.com/Lurk/serve). At some point, I needed a tool to serve the 
files that BAR produced. I reached out to the familiar Nginx but then wrote a simple Axum-based Rust program that did 
the job. The source code of the first version was smaller than the Nginx config would be. The current version supports 
TLS and is still very simple. I haven’t done any benchmarks, so I do not know how good or bad it is. But it did serve 
this particular page and did it well. 

Side note: Jeez, this whole HTTPS stuff nowadays is so easy to do. I spent a maximum of 10 minutes getting Certbot up 
and running. 

-----

I like the mantra of Rust dev:

- make it work
- make right
- make it fast

All pieces of that project are in the first stage. There is a lot of stuff that I am not proud of. But it works and 
can be improved. 

The main Rust related surprise is how easy async stuff is. Yes, there is nothing extra complicated, reading some files 
and sending some requests. But I read so many articles about how hard async in Rust is that I was expecting much more
hustle. 

Overall I am happy with the result. I will use tools, and knowledge that I got from this project in the future.

One month ago was my first day at Check24 as a software developer.

If it looks to you as a significant downgrade in my position, that's because it is. I choose the offer from Check24 for three reasons. First, it is a big product company, and I lack experience of that sort. Second I liked the interview process. It was easygoing, although I have never been on that side of a job interview in my life. The third reason is the location, we really liked Munich. Each of the above is more important for my family and me than the job title, so I downgrade.

I can not say for sure about the whole company because it is big. And there are no events to socialize because of the corona. Even in my team, I saw only five people in person. So although it is big, it feels like a startup. The idea behind everything and engineering in general - every project has one team. While every team does whatever it wants, my team wants and does Next.JS, MongoDB, and a little bit of everything around that. I was skeptical about this approach because, sooner or later, there should be some problems in communication between teams. But it seems like it is working pretty fine.

What I like are code reviews. In my previous job, I had no professional feedback. On the other hand, I could do whatever I wanted to do, but I often had no idea how to do things better. And life is too short to not trying to do things better. Now, we, as a team, helping each other to leave things in better shape than we are found them, and code reviews are a massive part of it. Second favorite thing - technical discussions. Twice a week engineering part of the team spends an hour talking about technical challenges we face and how to solve them. That also helps a lot in knowledge sharing, learning stuff, and keeping up with new things in general.

To wrap it up - I am glad that I made that decision, and looking forward not to change my mind :)

The most frequently asked question is - do I like it? And the short answer is yes.

What I like the most - everybody seems to be chill.

Did I find something that annoys me? I did not. Except, maybe, the real estate market, but you know, it is like being annoyed by rain.

The first week I was on self-isolation, so yeah, it was boring. But since it was snowy outside, and the flat has a balcony, I was able to make a friend :)

![my first friend in Munich](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1620243822/month_in_munich/friend.jpg)

Two things you should know about apartments in Munich. First - it is crazy expensive to rent a flat. Second - it is tough to rent. The only real option to rent an apartment remotely is [MrLodge](https://www.mrlodge.com/). And I can recommend them. Everything was smooth, and the flat was exactly as in pictures from the website. 

While I was at home, I tried to get a phone contract but failed because to get a proper one, you should have a bank account, and to have a bank account, you need to have a tax id. I heard that I could open an account in N26 bank, but they rejected my passport. So I ended up with a prepaid number by Aldi Talk. I ordered it online, but by the time the actual sim card arrived, my self-isolation was over, and I could buy it at any Lidl shop.

How to end self-isolation? You have two options. One is to wait five days, make a corona test, and if it is negative, you are free. Second, wait ten days, and you are free. I chose the first option, and on the morning of 10 April, I was tested negative and free to move around. After 10 km walking, I went to the grocery store,  bought charcoal, sausages, and beer. And in the evening I had a BBQ party on the balcony.

![my first BBQ in Munich](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1620249895/month_in_munich/bbq.jpg)

To get a tax ID, you should register yourself in KVR. Since it is corona time, you can do it remotely. To do that, you need to send an email to this address: **buergerbuero.kvr@muenchen.de**. In attachments should be a filled by you PDF form "[Anmeldeformular und Vollmacht](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/fachspezifisch/HA-II/Buergerbuero/Dokumente/anmeldung_meldebehoerde.pdf)", another PDF form "[Wohnungsgeberbestätigung](https://www.muenchen.de/rathaus/dms/Home/Stadtverwaltung/Kreisverwaltungsreferat/fachspezifisch/HA-II/Buergerbuero/Dokumente/Wohnungsgeberbest-tigung_Internet.pdf)" supplied by your landlord, your passport, and your visa.

!! IMPORTANT
! warning sign
Before you download those forms and fill them, go to [https://www.muenchen.de/](https://www.muenchen.de/) and check if they are still valid.
!!

Since I did not find any advice on what to write in the header and body of the letter, I wrote:

Hi, my name is Serhiy Barhamon. I just moved to Munich and want to register myself. In the attachment to this letter you will find:

I received my registration after two weeks and still waiting for my tax ID. Side note, do not forget to put your name on postbox.

A couple of times I went to the office on foot (an hour, free), most of the time I rent a bicycle (25 minutes, 2.4 euro) and when the weather is bad I use S-Bahn (25 minutes, 3.5 euro). Thinking about buying a bike but again, since this is a corona time, it is not easy to get to the offline shop, and online shops do not accept cache. So yeah, it is a good idea to have some money in your bank account when you're moving to another country. Don't be like me.

Now, when Mari got a visa, it was time to move to Munich for real.

The plan was simple. We pack our stuff in a couple of days send them to Munich. After that, we have a week to meet all our friends and family. Then we will fly to Munich, and we still had four days from my two weeks vacation left. Should I say that plan was over-optimistic?

![42 kilos of vinyl](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1633260267/moving_our_suff/42_kg_of_vinyl.jpg)

When we moved from Moscow to Kyiv eight years ago, all our stuff fit in the back of Skoda Fabia. But now. Now we have roughly 500 kg of things that we want to have with us. And some stuff that we do not want with us and don't want to throw away. So yeah, at the moment of writing this, I still feel pain in my back. But we did what we planned in 10 days. Packed and shipped all stuff we wanted to Munich (now I know that we have 42 kilos of vinyl). We took things that we didn't want with us to my mother's house. Renewed passport for our cat. I changed the screen in my mbp (that went really fine). We bought an extra luggage case last night before the flight. 

![my new mbp screen](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1633260263/moving_our_suff/new_laptop_screen.jpg)

If I do that again, I will budget at least two weeks only for packing stuff.

We chose [Ukr-Trans-Express](https://ukr-trans-express.com.ua/) company to move our stuff. The competition was between them and [Gosselin](https://gosselin-moving.com/en), but Gosselin was way out of our budget.  Everything went really smoothly. We hoped that cargo would arrive two or three weeks later, but in fact, it arrived at our new flat in Munich precisely one week after we put it in the cargo van in Kyiv. So instead of using leftovers from my vacation on chilling, we unpack and shuffle around our belongings.

![our pictures hanging on the wall](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1633260263/moving_our_suff/ART.jpg)

I am happy that the flat is equipped with a basement. Because otherwise, there will be no living space at all. I have barely fitted our sound system in it.

![our 'little' sound system](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1633260267/moving_our_suff/sound_system.jpg)

And I am really happy that the three of us are finally together, doing breakfast on the balcony, hikes on the mountains, and weekday living with all things you do on a regular weekday.

One of the questions I usually get on an interview - Tell me about a time that you had to deal with a tricky bug.

Oh boy. What to choose? Throughout my career, I dealt with many tricky bugs, one tricker than the other. But two of them stand out. So buckle up. Here is tail about the nastiest bugs in my life.

### Bug with blurry images.

Once upon a time, I did a UI framework for IPTV set-top boxes. It was React + Redux app, on top of a Chromium custom build, on top of 4.4.2 Android.

One day, I got a bug report - Channel icons are somewhat blurry. And two weeks of fun begins.

First of all, I checked the obvious things. Like maybe images are blurry in the first place? Or perhaps somehow I screwup the viewport in Head. Or whatever. But no, everything was fine except blurry images.

And finally, after a couple of weeks of reading documentation, make files, and source code of Chromium, I found out that there was a "feature" in Chromium with pixel density. The browser was detecting the Full HD screen on the Android device, which means we have a high dpi screen, but we do not. So every image, before rendering, first gets scaled up and then scaled down by the browser.

The only reasonable solution was to hardcode scale. So I patched our version of Chromium to use the constant scale.

### The server is on fire, customers on fire, me, also on fire. TCP.LAST_AKK timeout 60 seconds.

One day one of our video delivery edges began to behave strangely. No significant load increase was detected, no new software was deployed, no CPU spikes, no memory leaks, no SSD were damaged. But service experienced a considerable downgrade.

Only one thing was not normal - the count of connections in the LAST_AKK state was too high. That were connections to our access control service on localhost. Since the same service was deployed on other edges and everything was ok with them, I was like, WAT?

!!
The patch, which enables control of LAST_AKK timeout by finwait2_timeout option, sits in the FreeBSD tracker since 2001
!!

I read everything I can about TCP, connection states, timeouts, how it was implemented in FreeBSD, how to tune FreeBSD network, and so on. Spend two or three weeks on this.

!!
If you are running a FreeBSD server, this is the [best article about performance tuning](https://calomel.org/freebsd_network_tuning.html) I ever read.

Honestly, I still don't know why exactly it has happened. But the fix and the lesson was - do not use HTTP for local services, use Unix sockets instead.

If you are in tech twitter, especially in the JS part, you definitely read something about how bad redux is. Let me disagree :)

Yes, redux is complex, but not because of redux itself but because of the domain. We, as an industry, figured out that managing data is a complex activity a long time ago. So we invent all sorts of stuff to make life easier, including a couple of languages explicitly designed for data management. If you think this is an old man's tail, look around, and you will find a live DBA. But when the time comes to frontend, we somehow forget about all of that and treat app state management as unimportant. That must be the opposite. The frontend is, arguably, the second, after finances, important thing. Because if you mess up finances, you most probably go to jail. If you mess up your frontend, you will probably not have any finances to begin with (who wants to use software that feels slow and glitchy, right?). And the most crucial thing in your front end is the state. So yeah, if your app is complex, then you will have a complex state, which is complex by definition. But it Is not complicated unless you make it. Redux, like any other generic tool, does not prevent you from making your code complicated.

And, yes, redux requires some boilerplate code. But, let's stop for a minute and think about it. Redux is a state management tool. And the state is data. I  can say from my experience that if you want your data to have predictable properties, you will define models with types and relationships between them — every time. So yeah, it is a boilerplate, but it is a small price to pay for consistent data flow. You can argue with me about that, but before you do, take to account two things: 

- predictability - at any moment of a lifetime, you can easily take/load a snapshot of the whole application state. With this feature, application support and debugging became an easy task instead of a hard burden. I will happily trade any complication during the support lifecycle on 10x difficulties during development time because I know that my today's code will become legacy tomorrow. 
- performance - some time ago, I tried all the options on the market. Redux was the fastest. Not by a significant margin, but I had to take into account devices with very slow CPUs, so every fraction of a millisecond on my desktop translated to milliseconds on a device. And yeah, that led me to the “discovery” of this simple truth - if you add something on top of Object.assign (what every state manager is doing), you will pay the price in performance.

What I am trying to say: if you hope that some state library will magically make state of your app better - I have bad news for you. Most probably, the problem is not Redux, and you need to rethink your approach in general. At this point, I feel like I must give some examples, but I won’t. Because every app is different every example will be bad for some cases. Advice that helped me - remove all logic from the reducer, and keep your actions as simple as possible. Usually I end up with a way to dispatch array of actions when I need complex state change. 

Thank you for your attention :)

My friend asked me if I am writing somewhere about my relocation. So here I am.

**To give you some context:** I got a new job, and we (my wife, my cat and me) are moving from Kyiv to Munich. It is exciting and a little bit scary. Especially the speed. We decided to try living in Europe on 20 November 2020. I make a deal with [Check24.de](https://check24.de) on 27 January 2021. On 19 February 2021, I had an appointment at the German embassy. A week later, I got my passport back with a visa starting on 5 April 2021.

**The plan.** I am going to Munich first to do a "registration at the Citizens office."  Then Mary, through the family reunion program, joins me with our cat. We have anecdotal evidence that it takes two or three months. And we are kind of okay with that because we have the cat problem. To get our cat with us, she should have a laboratory report that she does not have rabies. And after that, she should be quarantined for 90 days. To get this report, Amidala, the cat, should have a particular type of passport. And some disaster happened two months ago. Nobody in Ukraine can issue such kinds of documents anymore. And it seems like nobody knows when somebody will. So we are actively looking for workarounds.

Sometimes I woke up in a morning with a thought, "Shit. We are doing it". Then I got overwhelmed with the count of things I should do. To deal with that, I open my to-do list. And after a while, I am thinking, "Shit. We are doing it". But with a smile. Highly recommend.

**Also**, we are selling our car and motorcycle. So if you need a good bike or/and car in Ukraine - drop me a message.

In just three days, we covered 1.315 km, visited abandoned military radar station "Pamir" and camp at beautiful sites.
Considering all the adventures, I would like to have at least one more day because the last day was very tough. But 
first things first.

-----

### Day 1:

We met with my friend, Gleb, at 8 am and drove off after drinking coffee. About every 100 - 150 km, we made stops to 
rest, have a snack, and drink water.

The road surface in some places was so bad that after 400 km (at a stop in Kamenets-Podolsk), we decided that it was 
time to look for a place to camp. Since the Dnister river is near, we decided to get there and find the right place on 
the shore. The site was not found right away, since, in those parts of the Dnister, there are rather steep banks, and 
where there is a gentle entrance to the water, people live.

-----

After breakfast, we packed up and drove towards our finish point. The first few kilometers, we drove along a gravel 
road, and then a winding road began with very decent asphalt. I don't know why, but I didn't turn on the camera, which 
I regret now.

In Starozhinets, the locals advised us to the "[Dzvony](https://goo.gl/maps/KJhKEwzmU6T2aGEF9)" canteen, and if you 
are hungry in this region, I highly recommend it. We ate very tastily at 120 UAH. (~ $ 4.5). But they don't work on 
Sunday. So on the way back, we had to look for alternatives.

After Dolishnii Shepit, the asphalt ends, and the fun begins. And I finally remembered that I took the camera and 
turned it on. You can estimate the quality of the road surface and the complexity of the route from the video below.

At the border post, which was locked with a key, we discovered that Gleb had caught the drill with his rear wheel. 
From passing locals, we found out where the nearest tire service is, and having tied the rear wheel to my motorcycle, 
I went to the service.

I hope it won't come in handy, but the tire service is in Selyatyn village 
([here's a point on the map](https://goo.gl/maps/3H41rM2UzVBY9PQ59)). The owner is not very fond of bikers. But 
luckily he is a fisherman, like me, so we find a common language.

It was not possible to seal the tube because the drill tore it up a lot. But luckily I had a spare with me. So we 
quickly changed it, pumped it up, strapped the wheel back to the bike, and I go back to Gleb. When we put back his 
bike together and pack our luggage, we rushed on.

After the village of Shepit, real adventures begin. The road is sometimes crossed by a river, sometimes there are huge 
stones and sometimes soggy and slippery clay.

At some point, we caught up with a convoy of 4x4 folks. For some reason, I turned off the camera, and then forgot to 
turn it back on, which I regret, because the most exciting thing was just beginning.

Overtaking one of the vehicles, I did not fit into the turn and put my bike down. I crumpled the top case, and, as it 
turned out later, the air got into the rear brake system, which led to the fact that the rear brakes were gone.

Going down the mountain without a rear brake is not very pleasant. But we did it and found a great place on the bank 
of a mountain river.

### Day 3:

Raspberry bushes grew right behind our tent, so we had oatmeal with raspberries for breakfast :)

After cleaning the campsite, we moved to a home. The navigator showed 613 km. On the nearest gas station, we fixed my 
rear brakes.

Before finding a place to dine,we bought a watermelon, and it was the most delicious watermelon in my life :)

Since we continued the shortest route from the very morning, the navigator led us mainly by secondary roads through 
the fields. And I was pleased about that because most of the way we drove along completely empty roads.

We reached Kyiv after midnight.

I'm happy we did it. Even though the last day was very tough, especially the last 100 km to home. I would repeat 
without hesitation)

Halfway home, we already started discussing where we would go next, so I'm sure this was not our last adventure.

I was fascinated by long motorcycle journeys since my first bike but started to think about it seriously while watching ["Long way round"](https://www.longwayround.com/long-way-round) a year ago. If you didn't watch it, I strongly recommend watching it even if you do not ride bikes. Because, you know, Adventure :)

-----

I do not have a team to manage visas and other boring stuff. So it will be at least a half-year journey. Thus I still don't know how to do it because of family, work, etc.

But I read a lot about it, so here is a couple of examples for inspiration:

The first woman who did solo round the world trip was [Anne-France Dautheville](https://www.facebook.com/annefrancedautheville). I didn't find a lot of info about that trip, but I can imagine that it was a hell of an Adventure in 1972. Just imagine no phones, no GPS, no fancy adventure bikes.

The first man who made a solo motorcycle trip around the world was [Carl Stearns Clancy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Stearns_Clancy). He made that in 1912 - 1913. At that time, I am not sure even the roads were there. If you think you need some unique bike for travel, look at his.

![Carl Stearns Clancy 1](/img/rtw/CarlStearnsClancy.jpg)

[Elspeth Beard](https://www.elspethbeard.com/). Her story remains unknown for 30 years. Go to her web site you won't be disappointed. (I know that Dave Calderwood apologized, but that letter steel makes me angry)

So yeah. You want to learn Rust and have a small project in mind. Like one hour adventure. In and out.

My small project was [Clink](https://github.com/Lurk/clink). The idea is pretty simple, get data from the clipboard, check if there link, clean the link from tracking params, put the cleaned link back to the clipboard. The first version of it ([0.1.0](https://github.com/Lurk/clink/tree/0.1.0)) was done maybe in two hours. This is not because I am smart, but because Rust is an awesome programming language. Then I posted a link to the GitHub repo on the [Rust subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/lkdeoa/side_project_clink_cleans_links_for_you/) and gathered some feedback. Project stabilized, aka I run out of ideas, at version [0.6.0](https://github.com/Lurk/clink/tree/0.6.0). All that time, I was a happy user, until I looked at Activity Monitor and saw that:

![Activity Monitor](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1626984426/rust_and_nsstring/activity_monitor.jpg)

That is when real adventure starts.

Usually, you write software for mac using Objective C or Swift. Sometimes you are crazy enough to do it in C, and the Objective C runtime exposes the C interface for you. But sometimes, for no particular reason, you want to learn Rust. And for that occasion, [Steven Sheldon](http://sasheldon.com/) created a [Rust wrapper around Objective C runtime](https://crates.io/crates/objc). If you are interested in details here is [the link](http://sasheldon.com/blog/2014/11/28/interoperating-between-objective-c-and-rust/) to his blog post where he explains what and why is going on.

How do you approach tasks like finding and fixing a memory leak in a program written in a language you barely know, which calls API you don't know? Good question.

First things first - tools. After some googling, I found that nowadays everything is easy.

installation is easy:

```bash
xcode-select --install
brew install cargo-instruments

```

usage also easy:

```bash
cargo instruments -t Allocations
```

And I get nothing. After some thinking, I figured out that Clink is never stopping, and that's why I do not get any traces. So I come up with this:

```rust
use clipboard::{ClipboardContext, ClipboardProvider};

fn main() {
    let mut ctx: ClipboardContext = ClipboardProvider::new().unwrap();
    for _ in 0..20_000 {
        match ctx.get_contents() {
            Ok(str) => println!("{}", str.chars().count()),
            Err(_e) => println!("{:?}", _e),
        }
    }
}

```

The idea is simple - get 20 000 times the value from the clipboard and, to be sure that there is something, print the count of chars. I know that I should count graphemes, but in this case, it does not matter. Here is what I got:

![full glory](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1626986443/rust_and_nsstring/full_glory.jpg)

Yeah. It produces a nice graph (there are no values on the axis, but the last value is 2.67 GB). But how to find what is actually leaking? I did not come up with a better idea than check all repeating allocations if there is corresponding free. Here is how good allocation looks like:

![good allocation](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1626986602/rust_and_nsstring/good_allocation.jpg)

And this is bad allocation:

![bad allocation](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1626986710/rust_and_nsstring/bad_allocation.jpg)

The stack trace is on the right side of the window. So now, finding where the memory leak is not a problem. In my case, the Clipboard crate calls NSPasteboard.readObjectsForClasses to get current clipboard content, but not Rust nor Objective C runtime knows who is responsible for freeing memory, so nobody frees it. Surprise! Here you can suggest - choose another crate to work with the clipboard. But the problem is that every other rust clipboard implementation for mac, in one way or another, copies [Avi Weinstock's implementation](https://github.com/aweinstock314/rust-clipboard/blob/9b35e2c7363d04d336309485503faa2de663f837/src/osx_clipboard.rs) and leaks :( 

So my first step was to simplify the code a little bit. Since the get_contents method from the ClipboardProvider trait returns a String, we can use NSPasteboard.stringForType, which produces NSString, and this is as close to the Rust String as it can get. For calling this method, and by calling method, I mean sending the message, we need to pass an enum value NSPasteboardTypeString as a param. I spent at least a couple of evenings trying to figure out where I can get this enum value. As always, everything is simple when you know it:

```rust
#[link(name = "AppKit", kind = "framework")]
extern "C" {
  pub static NSPasteboardTypeString: Sel;
}
```

Now we got our NSString, convert it to Rust string, and send the release to NSString after.

![disappointment](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1626987261/rust_and_nsstring/disappointment.jpg)

This is how disappointment looks like. But if you look at this screenshot long enough, you will see that leak is more than three times lower. The first allocations dump showed more than two and a half gigs of RAM, but this one is only 775 megabytes. So this means two things:

First - this is a huge win.

Second - there is at least one more leak.

The next leak was found in the INSString.as_str() method. You may ask WTF is INSString, and this would be a trait from the [obj-foundation](https://crates.io/crates/objc-foundation) crate. We convert NSString to C string, by reading data from a pointer which we get from NSString.UTF8String. This pointer, according to [Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1411189-utf8string?language=objc) should be freed at the time when NSString itself will be released or sooner. In reality, it is mostly true, except when you have characters outside the ASCII range. So it is leaking on the Objective C runtime level, or I again don’t understand how things are working. The solution that worked looks like that:

```rust
fn nsstring_to_rust_string(nsstring: *mut NSString) -> Result<String, Box<dyn Error>> {
  unsafe {
      let string_size: usize =
          msg_send![nsstring, lengthOfBytesUsingEncoding: NSUTF8StringEncoding];
      //we need +1 because getCString will return null terminated string
      let char_ptr = libc::malloc(string_size + 1);
      let res: bool = msg_send![nsstring, getCString:char_ptr  maxLength:string_size + 1 encoding:NSUTF8StringEncoding];
      if res {
          let c_string = CStr::from_ptr(char_ptr as *const i8);
          libc::free(char_ptr);
          Ok(c_string.to_string_lossy().into_owned())
      } else {
          libc::free(char_ptr);
          Err(err("Casting from NSString to Rust string has failed"))
      }
  }
}
```

What is going on:

+ We get the size of a string in NSUTF8StringEncoding. I did not find a way to import NSUTF8StringEncoding from anywhere, but according to ,[Apple docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/1497293-string_encodings/nsutf8stringencoding?language=objc), it equals 4
+ We are allocating memory of a size we got on a first step plus one. Plus one is needed because getCString returns a null-terminated string
+ By calling getCString, we ask to write a null-terminated string in UTF8 encoding to memory we allocated on step two
+ If the third step was successful
+ We creating a C string from a pointer we got on a second step
+ Free memory we allocated on a second step
+ Convert C string to Rust string and return it
+ If the third step was unsuccessful
+ Free memory we allocated on a second step
+ Return error

And here is the result:

![final result](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1626988109/rust_and_nsstring/final_result.jpg)

Now, this is how the win looks like. And Clink, after running a couple of days, still uses one MB of ram. If you are using Clink on a mac, which is very unlikely, update to version 0.6.1. I hope it is finally fixed :)

I reach the next level of understanding how **NSString::UTF8String** works under the hood. If you are interested in how I get here, please read my [previous post.](/post/rust_and_nsstring)

!! Disclaimer:
! lightbulb
Because docs are hard to understand and the source code of the runtime is closed, everything below is based on poking around, reading various GitHub issues, and pull requests. I am trying to say that I can not guarantee that there is no next level, but there are far fewer unanswered questions than before.
!!

So, we need to know that despite **NSString::UTF8String** in [apple doc](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/nsstring/1411189-utf8string?language=objc) noted as a property, it is a method. It creates [Data](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/data?language=objc) with null-terminated cstring in it and then autorelease it. In one stack overflow thread, which I can not find now, I read that it creates new Data only if NSString contains characters outside ASCII. That would explain why UTF8String behavior differs from documentation most of the time, memory is not freed when NSString receives release message, but sometimes it actually works as expected. But my [tests](https://github.com/Lurk/nsstring_leak/blob/main/src/lib.rs) do not confirm this theory. So I still don't know why runtime sometimes frees memory.

[Autorelease](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmAutoreleasePools.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20000047) is a new concept for me. The idea is to have blocks, outside of which autoreleased memory is actually released. Every app that runs on macOS is wrapped in one of those blocks. And if you do not add one yourself, all autoreleased memory will be released at the end of the app. That was the actual reason for the memory leak I fought. 

One more question is why **NSString::UTF8String** is slower than **NSString::getCString**? My [benchmark](https://github.com/Lurk/nsstring_leak/blob/main/benches/my_benchmark.rs) shows 12.998us vs. 10.208us. Which in absolute numbers does not look like a big deal, but it is more than 20% which is huge. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/Lurk/nsstring_leak) with test cases and benchmarks. If you know where this difference comes from or spot an error in the benchmark, please let me know.

I wish I knew how to write proper tests for memory leaks, but I still don't know. So, please, send help.

I missed my motorcycle adventures so much, and this spring, I will finally have a new one.

This will be one week's trip. The plan is to arrive in Istanbul on a plane, rent a motorcycle, and ride a loop around 2000 kilometers long. The first half will follow the [TET Turkey](https://transeurotrail.org/turkey/#2.22/53.69/6.35) route, but then we will ride back to Istanbul along the coast of the black sea. The daily distance budget is 250 - 350 kilometers. I tried to plan the route that way so we would camp on the banks of a river or a lake. Here is the link to the route: [Turkey adventure.](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1012453925) I am a big fan of [Komoot](https://www.komoot.com/) for route planning. Highly recommend.

![gear packing](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1676229058/tet-turkey/gear_packing.jpg)

I wanted to bring my fishing rod, but I do not have enough space in my luggage. Here is the list of things I packed:

- Tent
- Sleeping bag
- Sleeping mat
- Chair
- Cookset (gas stove, pot, utensils, etc.)
- Water filter
- Boots
- Jacket
- Gloves (two pairs)
- Helmet liners
- Rain gear
- Bunch of straps, paracord, net, carabiners, metal zip ties
- Knife
- Small wrench

All that is already 20 kilograms, so maybe I need to rethink what to bring with me or finally buy a new lightweight tent or wear boots instead of sneakers on the plane. I will also carry a helmet and a backpack with my clothes. Yeah, surprisingly, a lot of stuff.

![my trustworthy CAYENNE jacket](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1676229679/tet-turkey/jacket.jpg)

I think I might need a waterproof bag, because the idea is to rent something like CRF300L, and I doubt it will be equipped with a luggage system. But I am waiting for the information from my riding buddy, who now lives in Istanbul. He will check out rentals as soon as the riding season starts. So I will have more info on the bikes and what I need to bring with me or buy there on arrival. For sure, I want to have a tire repair kit and spare tube.

![my happy face](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1676229889/tet-turkey/perseverance.jpg)

While preparing gear I found out that I am barely able to zip up my jacket. But I still have a couple of months to fix that, and now I am a salad guy. Wish me luck and perseverance.

I convinced Dima that it is a good idea (that was easy), and we rode 2067 kilometers in eight days on motorcycles in 
May 2023.

## The route

Half of our route was based on [TET Turkey](https://www.transeurotrail.org/turkey/). Most of the time, it is a pleasant
gravel, dirt, or small road.Sometimes it is a wide highway. There are thousands of switchbacks in every shape and form. 
Tight, wide, left, right, up, down, steep, gentle, wet mud, dry mud, big rocks, small stones, gravel, sand, good 
asphalt, bad asphalt, snow, and any combination of all of the above. Sometimes trail disappears. Sometimes, it crosses 
a river, and sometimes it goes through a dead village. One section was on the dried creek bed, with big stones and a 
steep incline. I was dying on that hill, like, for real. My lungs were exploding. My heart was jumping out of my chest.
I spent all my energy fighting that hill. But we managed to conquer it despite the lack of experience. It was cold when
we reached the first high mountain covered with snow. We turned around a lot cos our way was blocked by deep snow. It 
felt like we were stuck there forever.At some point, we were riding through one of those dead villages, and I thought 
we needed to break into one of the houses, start burning furniture, hunt stray dogs, and wait for spring. A couple of 
days later, we drove through the snowy summit again. I don't know if that was gained experience or the sun shining, but
it felt much less dramatic and easier to drive. Whenever I thought I had seen everything, something new and beautiful 
came around the corner. One day we were climbing up through the canyon and ended up on a vast rocky plane with patches 
of cultivated soil here and there. It was unbelievably beautiful under the morning sun. And once we had long and 
tiresome descent from the mountain on a dirt road destroyed by the stream, which ended up with a wide and empty 
highway. It felt like a treat after hard work. At the end of the first half of our route was a 3000m summit. We decided
that we had enough snow already and skipped it.

I planned the route back to Antalya, choosing the smallest roads on a map. A lot of those roads are gravel or dirt
ones. The trail is still through the mountains but much lower than the way there. And, of course, we had our bit of 
adventures. Once the road ended up in a newly constructed water reservoir. The other time we ran into logs lying across
our way. So yeah, there were a few turnarounds and searches for an alternative route.

Overall it is a diverse and beautiful route. Sometimes it challenged us, but newer to the point of giving up.

And that smell when you drive into the forest.

## Navigation

I used Komoot for route planning because the desktop version is the best. The problem is the navigation part. It is not
built for a multi-day motorcycle adventure. It starts glitching after around 300 km and refuses to load the app after
1300km. That's why our recorded track has gaps. Those parts we did not manage to salvage from two phones. Which is not 
that bad, but next time I will use something else for navigation and trail recording. Good thing, though, Komoot allows
you to download GPX of the planned route, so I can still use it for route planning.

Here is our [planned route](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1046129032/zoom).

Here is our [recorded track](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1113525883/zoom).

## Nights

All nights, except one, we spent wild camping. We were too cold and tired that day to look for a camping spot. It was 
already evening when we reached civilization in the form of an asphalt road and a sign with the distance to the city of
Tashkent. In Tashkent, we drove past the hotel that looked abandoned twice before we decided to try the doors. For the 
15 euros, we got two rooms with a view, breakfast, and a shower. I have never enjoyed a warm shower that much in my 
life. On all other days, we started to look for the camping spot around 5 pm. Our requirements were simple: fresh 
water, no snow, and as far from civilization as possible. We could always find a place within 50km of our position. 
Sometimes it was relatively easy to reach, and sometimes, it was not easy at all. I vividly remember how I was tumbling
down the hill and praying that my motorcycle does not follow me. Thankfully it did not. That was 100 meters from only 
one flat patch of the land, big enough to put a tent there. But the spot was worth it.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tet-turkey-ride-2023-nights}}

-----

## Bikes

We got two [Honda CRF 250 Rally](https://www.honda.co.jp/CRF250RALLY/) bikes in the 
[Turkey Bike Rent](http://www.turkeybikerent.com/). One had 600 km on the clock, and the second had 16000 km. A guy 
said upfront that clutch is a weak spot of those bikes and that we should not ride deep sand or any other terrain that 
involves heavy clutch usage. If we do and run out of the clutch, it will be our problem. The older bike ran out of the 
clutch on a second day. I am sure it was not our fault, but that was our problem. The closest city where that clutch 
could be replaced was 60 km away. Those were the longest 60 km in my life, and I even was not riding a faulty bike. 
When we reached Isparta city, the clutch was replaced in an hour and 100 euros. On the same day, but later, I lost my 
license plate. I rode to the point where it was seen last time with no luck. It had already tried to escape on the 
first day, and we tied it with straps, but apparently, it was not enough. I asked the rental what I should do about 
that, and the answer was - nothing. So I rode half of Turkey without a license plate and any problem with the police or
anybody else.

Other than these two things, everything was smooth and without surprises. Rental did not try to charge too much for all
the beating we put bikes through. And the bikes performed so well that I would like to have one of those. There is one 
thing, though: you must change the seat on those bikes. It is impossible to sit on that seat for more than two hours. 
It hurts. I don't know why Honda hates butts so much.

## Food

We had a drip coffee (you can find it in [A101](https://www.a101.com.tr) shops) with some chocolate bars for breakfast.
We cooked something on our gas stove for dinner, and for the lunches, we stopped in different places. Once, we stopped
at the village's central square, and there was some gathering. We were guessing that it was either a funeral or a 
wedding. Locals invited us to the table and fed us—all in sign language. You should see our happy/surprised faces.
Nobody asked for money or something, but we left some anyway. Later we were told that, most probably, it was a wedding
when people from that and neighboring villages gathered for a feast.

Sometimes we asked locals where they eat, and occasionally entered first thing with the food we saw. On the first day, 
we saw many people sitting on the street. There was one free table. We decided that that was the place and rushed 
there. It turned out it was a game club where people played dominoes. Anyway, we got directions to the closest canteen.

Once, we visited a butchery, and the guy asked how much food we wanted. That was a new way of ordering food, so I asked
for half a kilo. Then he got the whole lamb out of a fridge, cut a piece of meat, and cooked it for us. Should I say 
that it was delicious? It was. As soon as we got food on our table, at least ten cats appeared and started demanding 
their share. Since then, if we saw butchery at lunchtime, we went straight there. And every time, it was awesome.

-----

## People

We drove through tough places where life is not easy and met few people. All of them were ready to help, show 
directions, fix our motorcycle, and give advice, tools, or food.

We asked one of those butchers to guide us to a good camping and fishing place. He gave us directions and said that 
fishing is prohibited there, but if someone (police) caught us, we should call him, and he will deal with that. Since 
then, we have a joke that we have a butcher in Turkey that can deal with the police.

Once, we met young guys on motorcycles, they wanted to race with us, and we wanted to know where the closest food and 
gas station was. We did not understand each other, but I am sure we are stars now in the Turkish part of TikTok. And 
once police officer helped us to find the nearest gas station because the one we were standing on was under 
construction. Now I have a police officer as an Instagram friend.

## Gear

At the last minute, I changed the chair to the hammock. There was no space for them, so I needed to choose. I used that
hammock only once and wanted a chair every evening. What really I missed was the multi-tool with pliers. There were a 
few instances when life would be much simpler if we had one with us. Once we borrowed them from locals, all other 
times, we were inventive. Also, at the last second, I put a waterproof poncho 
([molfar](https://www.turbat.ua/turbat_ukrainian/tent-poncho-turbat-molfar.html)) that also can be used as a tarp. We 
never used it as a tarp or a poncho, but we used it as a ground cloth daily. It was a crucial piece of equipment for 
loading/unloading, outfit change, and other camping activities.

This year I got a sleeping pad 
([Therm-a-rest NeoAir® XTherm™ NXT MAX](https://www.thermarest.com/de/isomatten/fast-and-light/neoair-xtherm-nxt-max-isomatten/neoair-xtherm-nxt-max.html)) 
as a birthday present from my wife. I finally battle-tested it, and it is the most comfortable sleeping pad I ever had.
We slept on rocks multiple times, and I felt nothing pointy. The first half of the trip nights were freezing. I even 
slept in my puffy jacket. So yeah, I am pretty sure our next big outdoor purchase will be three-season dawn sleeping 
bags. If you have recommendations, I am all ears.

I rode in my AVG K3 helmet, which I like, but I mostly rode with a wide-open visor, and the sun burned my nose and 
cheeks like never before. I want a helmet with a peak to reduce sunburns next time. One of the first gear for 
motorcycle traveling I bought was rain gear. It was long ago, and I was lucky enough never to use it. On the last day 
of this adventure, the pouring rain with thunderstorms and all that fun started right when we strapped all our gear to 
motorcycles. So I finally used it. What can I say? I need a bigger one.

We brought fishing gear with us and had the opportunity to use it only twice. Success was only last night when we 
bought canned corn as bait. Because of the rain, we have not cooked our catch but left it in the closest village for 
the cats.

Yeah! That was the one that you finish with a grin and yell - We did it. The only thing left is to cut the 7 hours of 
video from GoPro.

This post is about the good stuff I have done during my sabbatical.

I wrote already about my [two-day motorcycle trip](/post/central_ukraine). Also, I`ve made many short one-day trips, they are still fun and exciting. The thing I like the most about adventure motorcycling is the freedom to choose the way. You can go wherever you want, even if there are no roads. Time is the only constraint, but you can go pretty far and see a lot on a motorcycle.

Here some pictures I took during those one-day trips:

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&sma_20202}}

I also went fishing with my friends. We lived almost a week in tents on a border between Ukraine and Belarus. It was terrific. Our home was a small island between Dnepr and Starik rivers, with nobody around. We caught enough fish to cook it every day, and mushrooms grew just behind our tents.

We are very fortunate with the weather. Have no rain, and some days were so sunny, I even think of swimming, but the river was icy. And that was the end of October.

One night, we go for a walk around our island. It was a little bit scary, and also very beautiful. You know, trees in the light of flashlights, the shadows, sounds of birds and animals, found some plants that glowed in the dark. Unfortunately, no photo can convey what it was. So you have to take my word for it.

Here some photos from that week:

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&fo_2020}}

Also, for the first time in my life, I hiked to the mountain summit. It was not something like Everest, only 1500 height. But that was awesome, and I think I got a new hobby :)

My wife Mari and I spend ten days in the Carpathian mountains. Almost every day we go on a hike. Drank water from mountain streams, cooked food on our small gas stove. Even found a new friend, a little doggo with no name, but we call it Palkan.

And here some foto as well:

We even shot a short clip on the way home because what can be better than mountains?

One week left before my trip to the mountains on a motorcycle. The whole route is +/- 1400 km.

There are plans to visit the abandoned Pamir radar station in the Carpathian mountains and ride around.

I have three days for everything. Here is a rough plan.

Friday: Check out at 7 am. According to the plan, I need to drive about 650 km to the place of a stay. Put up a tent there, light a fire, have supper and, fighting off mosquitoes, go to sleep.

Saturday: For this day, the plan is to drive +/- 200 kilometers through the mountains without asphalt. Somewhere on the way to the Pamir, I will need to go through a border checkpoint as part of the route runs along the Romanian border.

Sunday: The road home is about the same 650 kilometers. If I go to the Bakota, it will be something around 700 km. Not sure about it.

It remains to come up with a menu, but it seems to me that it will be freeze-dried food. I tried ЇDLO before and it was very good. Get side bags from repair. Pack all my stuff and I ready to go.

At the weekend we spent the night on the shore in a tent. The first time in a long time I went to the river without fishing rods :)

Every time I return from a venture, I regret that I did not bring a camera with me. Because every time some kind of adventure happens. This time, the GPS led us through the forest, and at some point, we had to turn around and look for another road because the road in front of us turned into a swamp.

![Sunset at river](/img/IMG_3638.jpg)

We reached the place and did not regret it. Swam in the river, had dinner with a view of the sunset, fed mosquitoes. At night a thunderstorm began and we slept to the sound of rain :)

One night is not enough, but still better than nothing.

I don’t know how closely you follow the news around the Russian invasion of Ukraine. But recently, there was an accident with a Russian fighter jet. It happened in the city of Yeysk, which is about 70 kilometers from the Ukrainian border. Russian fighter jet en route to bomb Ukraine hit the nine-story apartment building and killed civilians in Russia.

It has already happened. You can not change it. Want it or not, this jet did kill civilians. So you can choose to be sorry for dead Russians or be happy about live Ukrainians.

If you can do both, please tell me how.

I used to drive a Honda X11. And this is a great bike that I still love. But I want to ride not only on asphalt. So I bought an even more ancient but no less legendary Africa Twin RD04 motorcycle.

![My old Honda X11](/img/x11.jpg)

It is already 30 years old, and I had to go after it 600 km, one way and halfway back on it (thanks to Igor, Denis, and Vlad for the adventure). But I am satisfied a little more than completely because I drove into such places on it that I could not have at X11. But, from some, I could not get out on my own.

![My new (old) Honda Africa Twin (XRV750)](/img/at.jpg)

And if I had a time machine, I would send me to the past and persuade the younger myself to take some kind of dirt bike instead of a street bike.

With the Russian invasion still ongoing, my feelings about us moving to Germany are obviously skewed. To this day, 
every day, at a random point in time, I suddenly realize how unbelievably lucky we are. We had the luxury of choosing 
where to go, we had time to prepare ourselves, and most importantly, it was our choice. It was a good choice. I will 
choose Munich again.

!! If you want to help Ukrainians, here is where you can do it
! handshake
- There are many pets in the fighting area whose owners were killed or displaced. They need food and medical care.
[uanimals.org](https://uanimals.org)

- I know those guys from my motorcycle life in Ukraine. They were saving lives then and do the same now. 
[motohelp.ua](https://motohelp.ua)

- Those guys are risking lives saving others on the front line: [hospitallers.life](https://www.hospitallers.life)

- Most importantly, all of that does not make much sense if the army of Ukraine does not have enough rounds, warm 
clothes, vehicles, etc. [prytulafoundation.org](https://prytulafoundation.org/en)
!!

Mari received a government grant to obtain the required work certification, I was promoted to team lead, and our cat 
finally got health insurance. So yeah, you know, I have nothing serious to complain about. Of course, there are small 
annoying things, like DHL’s weird style of delivering parcels, public transport not working because of strikes, or 
those bicycle self-service stations that are not adequately maintained. But I think we learned the ways to mitigate 
most of those annoyances.

![our flat in Munich](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1713718404/three_years_in_munich/flat_in_munich.png)

In the meantime, we are renting the same flat. Since my last report, we harvested our first tomatoes and jalapenos on 
our balcony.  This season we have big plans for broccoli. The thought of moving to a not far countryside still sits in 
the back of our minds, but we haven't taken any action to move. We were extra lucky with the current flat and can't 
find enough reason to justify the hustle. 

![almost ready do harvest jalapeños](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1713718411/three_years_in_munich/jalapeno_in_munich.jpg)

Ah. We Also saved the life of one of our elderly neighbors. That was a wild night full of action. In the end, we 
managed to call an ambulance and helped the arrived team to do their job. That required some German skills. My German 
is not good enough, and I am switching to English as soon as possible. Which I am not proud of, and I plan to put more 
effort into learning the language this year. But Mari is really good. So, in our family, she does the talking. 

Those were Germany-related changes in our lives. See you in a year.

Every year, we go on an adventure to celebrate our anniversary. This year’s adventure was the Tour du Mont Blanc hike.

## Day 0

##### 30 August. Munich - [Glacier Camping in La Fouly](https://www.camping-glaciers.ch/en/)

We chose not an obvious location to start - La Fouly. To get there, we had five trains and one bus. This year, we got 
to the train on time at 6:55. And the next one, and the next one, but in Vesp, we should have paid more attention. Our 
train left without us from the opposite side of the platform. We hopped on to the next one. But that changed our 
schedule, and we had time to explore the next city, where we discovered that Döner costs 20 euros in Switzerland 🤯

We got to the Glacier Camping in La Fouly around five o'clock. And at nine, we were already sleeping.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tmb-2023-day-0}}

-----

## Day 1

##### 31 August. [Glacier Camping in La Fouly](https://www.camping-glaciers.ch/en/) - [Rifugio Elena](http://www.rifugioelena.it/)

We were afraid of the cold. The forecast was three degrees in the night. But to be honest, it was not that bad. We 
have connecting sleeping bags, so we cuddled and stayed warm all night. 

The campsite has good facilities and warm water in the shower, which was a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. 

We had breakfast, a shower, and coffee, packed our backpacks, and started a hike around nine in the morning. Should I 
say that the walk was beautiful? 

Somewhere in the middle of it, we found an alm where we had a croque with a view. My croque was bread and ham bathing 
in the melted raclette cheese, and the view, well, there were mountains. Both were so good that I almost cried. 

The way to the border between Switzerland and Italy was always up, and we were already tired when we got there. Tired 
and happy that Rifugio Elena, where we will spend the night, can be seen.

Two hours later, we reached our today’s destination. By some miracle, we got a double room with a private shower, an 
unbelievable luxury. After washing ourselves, we went to dinner. We had a pleasant conversation and food and went to 
sleep right after the last spoonful of ice cream was gone.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tmb-2023-day-1-1}}

## Day 2

##### 1 September. [Rifugio Elena](http://www.rifugioelena.it/) - [Camping Grandes Jorasses](https://www.grandesjorasses.com/en/)

After our best breakfast in Refugeos, we went down to Courmajor. We stopped following the TMB trail at some point 
because today’s destination is on the side. The way down was nice and easy, and we got to the Camping Grandes Jorasses 
before lunch. After pitching the tent and having lunch, we fell asleep. When we woke up, camping was full of people. 

We found a piece of cheese, salami, and bread for dinner in a local shop. We even thought about getting a bottle of 
wine at some point but decided to get our vine tomorrow after a hike. 

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tmb-2023-day-2}}

-----

## Day 3

##### 2 September. [Camping Grandes Jorasses](https://www.grandesjorasses.com/en/) - [Rifugio Elisabetta](https://rifugioelisabetta.com/)

The night was much warmer than our first night in the tent. We had yogurt, some cheese, salami, and coffee for 
breakfast. I can eat only that for the rest of my life. 

We liked this camping very much. The spots for the tents are very nice, the facilities are in good shape, and the 
people are nice. 

While exploring the area around, we found that buses are free. We decided it was a sign and used it to reach closer to 
our next stop - Rifugio Elisabetta. 

Right before Final Hill, we walk around a swamp that reminds me of The Dead Marshes from Lord of the Rings. 

We got to the Rifugio just before they closed the kitchen. We had our anniversary lunch with a glass of wine and a 
glacier view.

## Day 4

##### 3 September. [Rifugio Elisabetta](https://rifugioelisabetta.com/) - [Les Chapieux aire naturelle de camping](https://www.google.com/maps/place/aire+naturelle+de+camping/@45.697511,6.7241103,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x478967e6537f8237:0x15114c89ccc72ecf!8m2!3d45.6956141!4d6.7342648!16s%2Fg%2F11g2_7fbnc?entry=ttu)

We slept in a room with four other people. Despite having a proper bed, sleep was not as good as we hoped. And the 
breakfast was relatively poor. And the shower requires renovation. But the view pays all off. Being that close to the 
glacier always gives me goosebumps.

The swamp below was covered with mist at sunrise, giving even stronger Tolkien vibes. 

We saw tens of fluffy marmots on the Italian side of the mountain, and the border is full of ancient ruins. 

On the way down, we found a memorial for the B-17 U.S. Army Forces crew. 

In La Fouly, we met a group of English people who also do TMB. We met them again at Camping Grandes Jorasses. We met 
them again today, and they sold us a can of Portuguese beer. The whole situation is hilarious, us buying Portuguese 
beer from an English man on a glorified parking lot in France.

## Day 5

##### 4 September. [Les Chapieux aire naturelle de camping](https://www.google.com/maps/place/aire+naturelle+de+camping/@45.697511,6.7241103,15z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x478967e6537f8237:0x15114c89ccc72ecf!8m2!3d45.6956141!4d6.7342648!16s%2Fg%2F11g2_7fbnc?entry=ttu) -

We got a fresh baguette at 7 a.m., made a coffee on our gas stove, and had breakfast with goat cheese and sausage. We 
wanted to start early because of the long hike ahead and the scorching sun, but we began at nine. 

It was a long and beautiful way up to the Refuge du Col de la Croix du Bonhomme, where we had lunch, and an even 
longer way down to the wild camping spot. On the way down, Maria’s knees started to hurt badly. We agreed that instead 
of Refuge de Plan Glacier tomorrow, we will go to the next camping and rest there.  

We got to our destination at sunset. A few tents were already pitched up, but we found our quiet corner with access to 
the small river.

## Day 6

##### 5 September. [Aire de bivouac de la Rollaz](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bivouac+Shelter+Nant+Borrant/@45.7448962,6.6239185,12.35z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x47895d567bc2abad:0x12c003f654645bb0!8m2!3d45.7734949!4d6.7173042!16s%2Fg%2F11hf6xz_ql?entry=ttu) - 
[Camping le Pontet](https://www.campinglepontet.com/en)

Mari could not sleep without painkillers, and we started to think that we would not be able to finish TMB at all. 

We got out of our tent only at nine. Breakfast, bathing in the icy river, and packing our camp took a surprising 
amount of time, and we hit the road again only around two. I liked our corner and wanted to stay. 

I sunburned my legs yesterday, and I was forced to wear my camping trousers today. It was very hot on the way down. I 
don’t understand how people hike this trail in summer. 

The pain in Maria’s knees returned as we started to go down, which was a sign that our hike was over. But starting 
tomorrow, we have booked two nights in a tiny cabin in Chamonix for our resting day. The plan for today is to get to 
the nearest campsite, cancel our booking at Refuge de Plan Glacier, and figure out where the nearest public transport 
stop is that we can use tomorrow. 

As soon as we reached the campsite, I emailed Refuge de Plan Glacier that we could not reach it. Ten minutes later, I 
got a call. On the other end was a man from the refuge. He was very upset that we would not arrive. He had already 
brought us food, which was expensive, and we notified him too late. We were also very upset about all that, plus knee 
pain. Unfortunately, I do not know the man’s name, but if you are somehow reading this, I am genuinely sorry that we 
did not notify you earlier.

The whole day people were arriving at the campsite. In the evening, it was the most packed camping site I had ever 
seen.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tmb-2023-day-6}}

## Day 7

##### 6 September. [Camping le Pontet](https://www.campinglepontet.com/en) - Chamonix

There was nowhere to hurry, so we had breakfast, showered, properly dried and packed our tent, met our Portuguese beer 
dealer, had a second coffee, and moved out to Chamonix around noon.

We found a bus stop relatively quickly, but the sign on it said that starting today, the bus would not stop at this 
stop. We consulted with locals, who advised us not to pay attention to the sign because they saw a bus that stopped at 
this stop today. They were right. 

Train to Chamonix goes through a beautiful valley. You can see the glaciers from the window! 

We reached our tiny cabin without any adventures, opened a bottle of wine, and spent our evening on a terrace with a 
view of Mont Blanc.

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tmb-2023-day-7}}

-----

## Day 8

##### 7 September. Chamonix 

We wanted to see the glaciers up close. However, the website that sells tickets to Aiguille du Midi cable car showed 
that all tickets are sold out. So we chilled till lunch and then went to explore Chamonix. We got to the cable car 
station almost accidentally and bought tickets there. The cabin was tightly packed. So yeah, if you want to stand by 
the window and see the beauty, try to enter first or last. 

The glacier is majestic. We took hundreds of pictures from every spot. And even though we knew it was the end of our 
trip, that was an excellent place to end it. 

We spent the rest of the day on the terrace of our cabin enjoying vine, cheese, and the view of the glacier on a 
sunset. 

{{cloudinary_gallery|barhamon&tmb-2023-day-8}}

-----

## Day 9

##### 8 September. Chamonix - Munich

We hopped on FlixBus to Geneva early in the morning, where we had another bus to Munich. On the way, we spent some 
time in traffic and arrived home around midnight. 

## Day N

After we got home, Mari visited a doctor. He said that her knees are not damaged enough to have surgery but damaged 
enough to stop mountain hiking 😔

Yeah, it looks like the next adventure would be a road trip or kayaking.

-----

## Afterword

It is a very crowded route. This is expected because it is the most popular long-distance hiking route in Europe, 
but we were not ready for that amount of people. If you, like us, go hiking to disconnect from society and reconnect 
to nature, I recommend choosing another route.

Otherwise, everything promised: three different cultures, a well-maintained trail, countless options to resupply, and 
unbelievably stunning nature are there.

This year is my wife's turn to come up with a vacation plan, and we will go on a two-week hike around Mont Blanc 
Mountain.There is a well-known hiking trail named, surprise, 
[Tour du Mont Blanc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tour_du_Mont_Blanc), which is around 160 kilometers long and crosses 
three countries: Switzerland, Italy, and France.

While researching the trail, we discovered a picturesque lake in the mountains where wild camping is allowed. And 
because of that, of course, we need a new lightweight tent and sleeping pads. Our old and trustworthy tent weighs 4.7 
kilos, and our very comfortable self-inflating sleeping pad is as big as my backpack.

![Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm Max](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1690395823/tmb-preparations/thermarest_neoair_max.jpg)

After reading thousands of reviews, we chose the 
[Therm-A-Rest NeoAir XTherm Max](https://www.thermarest.com/de/isomatten/fast-and-light/neoair-xtherm-nxt-max-isomatten/neoair-xtherm-nxt-max.html) 
as our sleeping pads. Nothing can beat its insane R-value at that weight, volume, and price. I battle-tested it in my 
[Turkey adventure](/post/tet_turkey_ride). It is super comfy and warm. We had two contenders for the tent, 
[MSR Huba Huba NX 2](https://www.msrgear.com/ie/tents/backpacking-tents/hubba-hubba-nx-2-person-backpacking-tent/06204.html) 
and [Big Agnes Copper Spur](https://www.bigagnes.com/products/copper-spur-hv-ul2). Both tents are around 1.5 kilos. 
Both can fit two wide sleeping pads. Copper Spur is lighter and has more storage options, while Huba Huba feels 
sturdier. It was a tough choice, but MSR won in the end. I have already used it on a few short adventures, and it is 
the best tent I tried in my life.

![it is nice to hike knowing that you do not need to carry food for a week](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1690395852/tmb-preparations/msr_huba_huba_nx_2.jpg)

Camping means cooking food. We want to bring our gas stove, a small aluminum pot, foldable silicon cups, and 
freeze-dried food. Of course, we prefer cooking real food, but we tested freeze-dried meals, and some are good. And 
coffee, judging by my wife’s determination, half of her backpack will be coffee beans. The good thing is - that we 
don't need to carry all the food from the start because there are plenty of places to resupply.

![Hiking cook set in action](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1690395836/tmb-preparations/cooking_food.jpg)

It looks like our base weight will be around nine kilos. Judging by the online information, you do not need more than 
one liter of water for a day on that trail. So it plus one kilo. The longest stretch without food resupply is three 
days. If we want a meal three times daily, that's nine packs per person. There will be plenty of places to eat, but 
shops with trekking food are rare, so those nine packs include an emergency stash. Each bag is around 210 grams, which 
is 1890 grams in total. Summing all that up, the whole backpack should be around 12 kilos. It is a good weight, I would
even consider adding a chair, but the backpack has no room left.

![Gear for the TMB](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1690395845/tmb-preparations/gear_for_the_tmb.jpg)

This is how our route looks like - [TMB](https://www.komoot.com/tour/1010233496). We roughly planned the route on 
Komoot (they do not pay me, I like their route planner), then looked for sleeping options so the daily distance stays 
reasonable, and then booked whatever we needed to book. One Hütte was booked out for the night we wanted to stay—nine 
(9) months in advance. But, because we will carry our camping gear anyway, it is not a big deal.

![Tour du Mont Blanc route map](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1690395857/tmb-preparations/tmb_route_map.png)

The only thing left to do is to renew tips on our trekking poles. Ah, and buy tickets to Switzerland.

See you on the trail.

Unbelievable how relative time is. It feels like we have lived here for at least twice as long.

There is a stereotype that Germans are cold and grumpy. IDK, everyone I met was helpful, polite, and welcoming. And since we are on the stereotypes page, bureaucracy. I did not notice anything unreasonable. Maybe it is my thing. Germany is the fifth country where I live, and perhaps I developed subconscious routines to avoid all of it. Maybe. But yeah, I do not have much to complain about. Oh no! You know, I have a thing to complain about. In Munich, we have self-service bike stations, you know, essential tools, air pumps, and so on. They are scattered across the whole city. And you know what? On most of them, the air pump is broken. As Germans would say - this is unacceptable.

![Nothing to complain about](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1681502257/two-years/nothing_to_complain.jpg)

We visited a few other cities in Germany, and every time we thought that we would choose Munich again. We like the absence of skyscrapers in the city, the nature around it, the rhythm, and the density of cultural events. We are still thinking about moving to the not far countryside. But it is so convenient to have 20 minutes commute time and one hour to the mountains that moving is still on the back burner.

![Our tiny flat](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1681502509/two-years/our_tiny_flat.jpg)

Still no car and no motorcycle. We do not feel like we need a car. Despite all the complaints you can find online, public transport in Munich is excellent. Of course, I want to ride a motorcycle, but I also enjoy bicycle rides and knowing myself, I will stop riding a bicycle the moment I get a bike. Which I do not want to happen.

![Bicycle trip](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1681502739/two-years/bicycle_trip.jpg)

Language-wise, I can manage a micro talk. But Mari is making tremendous progress. She can have a meaningful conversation with a stranger on the street while I nod and smile. This outstanding achievement of mine was brought to you by doing daily Duolingo exercises. I started to think about coming back to the language course. My previous attempt finished at the A2.1 level, cos there was not much sense in continuing with my tiny vocabulary. Still not sure when, maybe after this year adventure.

![We like our adventures](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1681502862/two-years/adventure.jpg)

I got a promotion. My current position is the lead developer at Check24. Now I officially have less time to focus and more time to talk. But yeah, I am pretty glad about that. Apart from promotion, there was a 3-year LTC, which is basically our (employee/employer) mutual agreement that we want to work together for at least three years more. I needed some time to think about it before I signed. It felt like I am getting too comfortable in my comfort zone, and that commitment will force me to stay in it for three years more. But then, I thought I would have my stress out of the language courses and obtaining permanent residency in Germany, so at least I would not need to look for a new job.

![Playing music in the train](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1681503053/two-years/portable_music_station.jpg)

When I say I am getting too comfortable, I am not joking. I have an indicator for that - my music. In total, I recorded six tracks in seven years—four of those tracks I recorded this year. And I like that very much. I even massage the thought of having a vinyl record with those records. It is not as complicated/expensive as I initially thought. A few more tracks, and you will be able to preorder it.

Some time ago, I saw interview question: given a function that produces uniformly distributed random numbers between zero and one. Calculate the Pi.

Wtf was my initial reaction. Who in the right mind would ask a question like this? But then I needed an excuse for not doing the dishes, and here we go.

My first association with Pi number is the circle area formula **Pi*r^2**. How can we relate our random numbers to a circle? Let say the distance between min(0) and max(1) is our radius. You can picture it like this:

![look at this beautiful circle](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1631391738/random_dots/circle_nbe72s.png)

The next question is how to plot our random number on 2d plane? We will call it twice. One for **X** and second for **Y**. 

![look at those beautiful dots](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1631391738/random_dots/dots_ghjllu.png)

If we repeat this enough times we get a square with a side length that equals 1

![look at this beautiful square](https://res.cloudinary.com/barhamon/image/upload/v1631391738/random_dots/square_tpmwws.png)

Now we need to combine our circle and square.

Looking on it, Pi should be the difference between the area of a square and the area of a quarter of a circle.

It is time to dust off my math skills.

Area of a circle - **Pi*r^2**

Area of a quarter of a circle (QC) - **(Pi*r^2)/4**

four quarters equals full circle (obviously) - **4*QC = Pi*r^2**

then - **Pi = (4*QC)/r^2**

What is **r^2**? It is area of a square (AS) 

then - **Pi = (4*QC)/AS**

In English, that would be Pi equals area of e circle divided by the area of a square where the radius of a circle equals side of the square.

Now, how can we know the area of the square? Remember when we draw a square with our random dots? So count of those dots will be our area.

And the area of our quarter of a circle would be a count of dots with distance from the 0 less or equal 1. The distance formula is **d = sqrt((x2-x1)^2+(y2-y1)^2)**.

But since we want distance from 0,0 we can simplify that to **d = sqrt(x^2+y^2)**.

Where x and y are the coordinates of our random dot.

It is time to write some code.

{{https://replit.com/@SergeyBar/rustrandom?lite=icon_title_nologo&theme=replitLight|https://replit.com/@SergeyBar/rustrandom?lite=icon_title_nologo&theme=replitLight}}

I would not recommend using this method to calculate Pi for something serious. First. How to say it lightly. The accuracy of this method is not the best on the market. And second, to get stable accuracy to the second digit, you need 10 000 000 dots. So yeah, performance-wise, it is not the best method either. But it was fun.

Now I don't have any excuses left.

Since English is not my native language, it’s hard for me to express my thoughts on it. I hope that writing posts regularly (!important) will improve my speaking skills.

The second reason is education. Being a developer means that you are constantly learning, at least if you want to progress. The best way to learn is to explain what you are learning. I'm not sure if this works with everyone, but it works with me.

So, be ready to read about:

- Building software.
- Adventure motorcycle riding.
- Fishing.
- Camping.

And music. God, I love music. Someday, here you will find an archive of all my favorite albums with covers and links to listen.

[YAMD](https://github.com/Lurk/yamd) stands for - Yet Another MarkDown (flavor) and is a simplified version of 
[CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org/).

## Why does someone even need a simplified version of CommonMark?

I’m glad you asked.

I started doing it because I thought it would be fun and easy. The fact that it is version 0.14.0 should tell you that
it was not easy for me, but I had tremendous amounts of fun and learned quite a few new things.

!!
! computer
That's one of the reasons I like software engineering. The depth and breadth of it feels endless. I have been doing it
in different capacities since I was six and haven’t even scratched the surface.
!!

Actually, I had a few more solid reasons for a new flavor and parser for it:

- I haven’t found any library that would expose an intermediate structure instead of the resulting HTML. That’s not
true anymore. If you are happy with CommonMark, check out the [markdown-rs](https://github.com/wooorm/markdown-rs)
crate.
- I found that all markdown flavors lacked important blocks:
 + Image Gallery
 + Highlight.

Now, I learned a few things about the topic, and I have a few more reasons to continue.

CommonMark defines the [precedence](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.31.2/#precedence) of a container block over a leaf
block. I haven’t found any need for that, except when you want multiple paragraphs in one list item. I do not think
markdown is a good format to convey such a complex structure. On the other hand, there are fewer rules to encode and
remember without discrimination by block type. This results in a better UX and potentially allows a more efficient
parser.

There are a few caveats, though:

+ The tooling (linter, formatter, and LSP server) needed to write the correct YAMD does not exist and will take a long
time to become available.
+ List items can contain only one paragraph. At least for now.
+ I can be wrong.

There are a few more points why I continue with YAMD.

- No one needs more than one way to convey a heading or any other node. Trust me.
- Using numbers to identify an ordered list is not user-friendly. I spent enormous amounts of time fixing those
numbers while shuffling list items, and in YAMD, it is just `+`.
- I still need an Image gallery and Highlight.

## Okay. Okay. What’s in this release?

Finally, there is [documentation](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/). It is not much, but it is honest work. I did my
best to describe how it works, sometimes even why, and It took me an unbelievable amount of time.

!!
! list-check
While writing documentation, I realized I could not host YAMD documentation written in YAMD because you need tables.
So yeah. Maybe.
!!

## Breaking changes.

This release is full of breaking changes. As always, I hope that this is the last release like that. This time,
though, there is more ground for that hope.

### [Highlight](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/nodes/struct.Highlight.html).

While writing documentation for Highlight, I noticed that CommonMark reserves the `>` symbol for backquotes. If I leave
it like that, converting from CommonMark to YAMD and back will be unnecessarily complicated. To avoid that
complication, Highlight now has a new syntax. Please check the docs for more info.

### [Images](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/nodes/struct.Images.html).

The transition from ImageGallery to Images breaks both syntax and API. While writing a parser for
[Image](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/nodes/struct.Image.html) and ImageGallery, I noticed that wrapping a sequence
of images with `!!!` is unnecessary. I added them because I thought it would be much easier to parse when I wrote the
first version of YAMD, which is not valid anymore. And since I am already breaking syntax, it was an excellent
opportunity to fix that mistake.

### Frontmatter

From now on, the Frontmatter must be parsed by a consumer. There is no reason to force a specific metadata format or
shape in the YAMD, and from now on, the metadata field will contain an optional string that the consumer can parse
from the preferred format to the required structure. That means breaking changes in the API and syntax because a new
version can potentially contain invalid YAML, such as a JSON.

I hope that's the last breaking change in YAMD syntax. It’s not guaranteed, but from now on, I promise to figure out a
way for easy migration. The biggest obstacle is the absence of a serialization back to YAMD.

Next up, breaking changes in API. It is hard to stop when you start breaking stuff.

### Text

The Text node was just wrapped String without adding any new functionality. From now on, when the yamd instance
contains text, it will be String. That also forced me to change Enum representation from
[Internally tagged](https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html#internally-tagged) to
[Adjacently tagged](https://serde.rs/enum-representations.html#adjacently-tagged). As a side effect, Yamd will not
have reserved words from now on. Before that, nodes were not allowed a field with the name 'type’ because it was
reserved by Internally tagged enum representation when serializing.

### Bunch of other breaking changes.

The documentation writing also inspired me to rename the `nodes` field to `body`. It makes more sense and aligns with
the terminology. I am also renaming InlineCode to
[CodeSpan](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/nodes/struct.CodeSpan.html) since I use CommonMark as a reference. And I
am also renaming all shorthand enum variants to a full name, which makes more sense. I believe that is also a way
forward:

- No shorthands in the API.
- When in doubt, use CommonMark as a reference.

I need to add those rules to the documentation.

## New features.

Apart from breaking changes, YAMD has exciting new features.

From now on, YAMD will support escaping sequences. Before, there was no way to represent `\`` inside
[CodeSpan](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/nodes/struct.CodeSpan.html). Which was very annoying and the actual reason
for this release. To fix It, I added a [lexer](https://docs.rs/yamd/latest/yamd/lexer/struct.Lexer.html) and rewrote
the parser. It took me ages to get to the point when it worked and had a way to move forward.

!!
! lightbulb
A better Idea might be to use packages such as [Logos](https://github.com/maciejhirsz/logos) to generate Lexer. It
would save me at least a month, but it would also strip me of all the fun and frustration.
!!

Lexer also allowed me to implement `\\r\\n` support quickly. It is literally one line of code.

## Plans:

I think I have covered all the new stuff. Here is a plan for the future:

- Serializing to YAMD.
- Tooling like linter, formatter, and LSP server.
- Table node.

## Wrapping it up.

That was a lot of stuff, and I bet I forgot something. But the main goal is to start a conversation. If any of that
interests you or if you have strong opinions on the matter, please write to me. I would very much like to talk about
it.

Those are the notes I took while implementing [YAMD](https://github.com/Lurk/yamd) crate. 

-----

First of all, it is more complex than it looked in the beginning. 

The test case for nested lists is failing. I rewrote the deserializer logic multiple times. I rewrote half of the 
project. Two weeks later - Oh, a space is missing in the test case. 

Naming is really hard. How should I name a thing that contains a vector of patterns? Is it a Token? 

Most of the nodes do not require context for deserialization. But a few of them, you can only deserialize correctly 
with context. Adding an optional param to deserialize is a bad idea because that would mean two things. First, I will 
need to add None to every deserialize call. Second, that would be a longer explanation, so bear with me. 

```rust
trait deserializer {
 pub fn deserialize(input:&str)->Option<Self>{}
}
```

I want to add context, right?

`Fn deserializer(input: &str, context:` <What type should be here?>`)`

It does not make much sense to specify type here because every node can have it is own context type. Generics will 
pollute (is that a term?) the tree all the way up.

For now, I am fighting the urge to go and check how it is done in Serde. They should have solved this problem years 
ago. 

You know what? Maybe I do not want to have context. But I want a read-only access to the parent, which will implement 
some traits. 

Ok. I checked Serde. And yes, they had this problem. The solution is 
[Trait serde::de::DeserializeSeed](https://docs.rs/serde/latest/serde/de/trait.DeserializeSeed.html). IDK, it looks 
like it will have the same problem as the generic context approach from above.

I massaged the idea of a parent instead of context. It does not work, or I did not figure out how to make it work. The 
problem is:

```rust
fn deserialize<Parent>(input: &str, parent: Option<Parent>) -> Option<Self> {
	<what type Parent is?> 
}
```

It turned out that I needed to pass multiple values in one context. I ended up with a wrapper around HashMap. It may 
not be the best approach, and I could remove the HashMap in the future, but from what I read, all alternatives will 
involve some unsafe code, and I do not feel comfortable enough yet. For now, it works, and I can finally finish the 
List node deserializer.  

It may be time to write some documentation. 

I just rewrote the matcher for the third time. Maybe using regex is not a bad idea. 

Oh, “yamd” is free on crates.io. 

Publishing a crate went surprisingly smoothly. 

GitHub shows [John Hoo](https://github.com/jonhoo) as a contributor, which is technically accurate, but he does not 
know about that.

Now, when I publish those notes, I think I should do that more often. It is a good way to keep track of the project.

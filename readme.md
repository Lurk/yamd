## Status

It is not ready.

## Why?

Initial idea was to create human readable text format for my blog. Why not existing flavour? 
Existing flavours do not have elements like image gallery. And it turned out really fun adventure.

## Plans

Since the first priority is ease of adding new elements(nodes) looks like the most likely outcome 
is a toolkit to create new flavours. At some point it will stabilize, and then docs, even more tests, 
benchmarks, etc.
